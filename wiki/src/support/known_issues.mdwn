[[!meta title="Known issues"]]

Some machines have been reported to have problems starting Tails.

This list might not be accurate nor complete.

[[!toc]]

Tails will not use memory after the first 3 GB
----------------------------------------------

Tails will not currently use more than 3 GB of memory, even if more
is installed on the system. This is a limitation of the [[current
kernel selection mechanism|todo/nx_bit]].

Tails will only use one CPU core
--------------------------------

Tails will not currently use more than one CPU core, even if there is
more core or more CPUs installed on the system. This is a limitation of the
[[current kernel selection mechanism|todo/nx_bit]].

Tails does not erase all the system memory on shutdown
------------------------------------------------------

Tails does not consistently [[erase all system memory as it
should|bugs/sdmem_does_not_clear_all_memory]].
It depends on the overall system memory, but it currently fails
to properly erase around 1.5 GB on a 4 GB system.

Connecting to FTP servers is not possible
-----------------------------------------

Public FTP servers on the Internet are not reachable using Tails.
See [[the corresponding task|todo/fix_Internet_FTP_support]] for more details.

YouTube video are hard to get
-----------------------------

[[HTML5 video are not easily seen on YouTube|todo/easier_YouTube]]. When the
message *This video is currently unavailable* appears, the video can actually be viewed.
Right-click on the page, select **NoScript** → **Blocked objects** and
**Temporarily allow…** the video.

Tails will never support videos which requires Flash (those with ads).

Apple hardware
--------------

For the moment, Tails has a very limited support for Apple hardware.

Most recent Apple hardware does not boot without UEFI, and currently
Tails does not start with UEFI. See the corresponding
[[ticket|/todo/UEFI]].

Dell Inc. Latitude E6430/0CPWYR
-------------------------------

Do not start on USB sticks created using Tails USB Installer.

With BIOS versions A03 06/03/2012

Error message: `Invalid partition table!`

Dell System XPS L702X/03RG89
----------------------------

Do not start on USB sticks created using Tails USB Installer.

With BIOS version A17 02/22/2012

Some users reported that the legacy BIOS shipped by Dell doesn't know
how to deal with the GPT partition scheme installed by Tails USB
Installer.

ThinkPad X220 / T520
--------------------

See the corresponding [[ticket|/bugs/ThinkPad_X220_vs_GPT]].

Default search engine is Google for some languages
--------------------------------------------------

[[Some languages gets Google as the default search
engine|bugs/languages_without_a_localized_Startpage_get_Google_by_default]]
instead of Startpage.

After using liveusb-installer, the "emergency shutdown" doesn't work.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The liveusb-installer messes a bit too much with the USB devices for the
"emergency shutdown on media removal" feature to continue working after using
it. If you believe this feature is critical for the session you're running, we
advice you to reboot Tails.

Documentation viewer crashes when clicking on an internal link
--------------------------------------------------------------

The [[documentation viewer will simply crash when clicking on an internal
link|bugs/yelp_crash_with_inline_links]]. Until the problem is solved, do not
rely on them and scroll down manually.

Sub-optimal default mirror
--------------------------

The default Debian mirror is `cdn.debian.net`. Due to bad interactions with Tor,
downloads will sometimes fail with *Hash mismatch* errors. If it happens, try
again using a new Tor circuit.

Universal USB Installer does not install Tails properly
-------------------------------------------------------

We think Universal USB Installer has a bug that prevents from installing
Tails with the newest versions of the installer.

The installation goes fine but at boot time, the boot process ends with
a black screen showing a "boot:" prompt. Pressing **Enter** makes the
following line appears for a fraction of second: "Initial menu has no
LABEL entries!" and the goes back to the "boot:" prompt in a loop.
