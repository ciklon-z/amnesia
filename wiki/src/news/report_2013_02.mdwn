Releases
========

Tails 0.17 was released on February 25th. See the [[release
notes|/news/version_0.17]].

Metrics
=======

  - 99Â 275 connections of Tails to the Tor network. This makes a boot
    every 24 seconds on average (this number is an approximation from
    the requests made to the security announcements feed. The later is
    retrieved by Tails after being connected to Tor to eventually
    encourage users to update.)

  - 63 reports were received through WhisperBack.

  - 924 comments were posted on the forum, with 161 signed by Tails.

Code
====

  - Some progress has been done on a persistence feature to 
    packages installed with APT.

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/remember_installed_packages]]

  - A workaround has been proposed to temper a bug on APM handling of
    some hard disks that could damage them. See [[!debbug 684241]].

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/less-aggressive-hard-disk-APM-on-AC]]

  - Two features that are known to be flawed in Pidin, MXit and
    Sametime, have been disabled. See CVE-2013-0273, CVE-2013-0272 and
    CVE-2013-0271.

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/disable-flawed-Pidgin-features]]

  - Shutdown and reboot launchers have been added to the menu to fix the
    lack of a shutdown helper applet in camouflage mode.

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch bugfix/shutdown_with_camouflage]]

  - Some progress was made on Tails based on Wheezy.

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/wheezy]]

  - The firmware loader for Qualcomm Gobi USB chipsets was added to
    Tails 0.17.

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/gobi-loader]]

  - Some work has been done on getting the Tails web browser (now
    based on Iceweasel 17 ESR + Torbrowser patches) ready for Tails 0.17.

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/torbrowser]]

  - I2P was updated to 0.9.4.

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/i2p-0.9.4]]

  - We have tested [[Yama and AppArmor LSB
    stacking|todo/restrict_access_to_ptrace]] on Linux 3.7.8, and now
    plan to have Yama enabled by default in the Debian kernel.

Documentation and Website
=========================

  - The documentation on administration password was improved to be more
    clear about opening a root terminal.

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch doc/administration_password]]

  - A branch was started to clean up the content of the forum.

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch doc/sort_the_forum]]

  - The /bugs and /todo sections of the website will no longer be
    shipped in the ISO images.

    Git commit: [[!tails_gitweb_commit 4332f98d370dfa2ca9e9e312823a56009e2ab0ca]]

  - A link to check.torproject.org was added to the [[new default
    browser homepage|/news]], to reassure users landing on it.

  - The documentation on MAC Changer has been corrected to mention the
    fact that MAC addresses are sometimes sent over the Internet.

    Git commit: [[!tails_gitweb_commit 0d9718dad2f9ef577015b26194e81053402a459e]]

  - Some more browser fingerprinting issues where documented.

    Git commit: [[!tails_gitweb_commit 3e13999b6923ebfb3b25d7329ce0ce3d495ae63b]]

  - Our [[income statement for 2012|doc/about/finances#index3h1]] was
    published.

  - The browser [[homepage|news]] was lightened a bit.

  - The design documentation for [[todo/set_wireless_devices_state]]
    was written.

    Git branch: [[!tails_gitweb_branch feature/set-wireless-devices-state]]


On-going discussions
====================

  - We have been debating on a keyboard shortcut overlap between
    ALT+SHIFT+TAB that should change the window backward and ALT+SHIFT which
    is the usual shortcut for switching between keyboard layouts. That's
    particularly important for people switching between Latin and
    non-Latin keyboards.

    <https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-February/002610.html>

  - There is now a dedicated mailing list for the development of the
    Metadata Anonymization Toolkit (MAT).

    <https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/mat-dev>

  - Runa's report on "Training Journalists in Istanbul" resulted in a
    few discussion threads regarding, among others:

    - [Autostarting
      Iceweasel](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-February/002652.html)
    - [The browser
      homepage](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-February/002651.html)
    - [Having an applet that informs about the version number of Tails
      and hiding the download button on the News
      page](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-February/002653.html)
    - [Disabling all Pidgin accounts by
      default](https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-February/002654.html)

Infrastructure
==============

Quite some work was done on a new dedicated server of ours, called
lizard:

- Various stuff that's customary for a virtualization host, like
  a local APT proxy and a Puppet master, was setup.
- Our APT repository was [[migrated to
  lizard|todo/migrate_APT_repository_to_lizard]]. Our primary
  (private) rsync server,
  [[too|todo/migrate_primary_rsync_server_to_lizard]].
- We now [[todo/run_a_BitTorrent_seed_on_lizard]].
- We now [[todo/run_another_WhisperBack_relay_on_lizard]].
- We now run [[!debpkg bitcoind]] on lizard.
- Our Puppet modules are now hosted on lizard. Some are [[already
  publicly available|contribute/git]], but there's a bit of boring
  work left to [[publish the others|todo/publish_our_Puppet_modules]].
  We're happy to [share with nice
  people](https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/sharedpuppetmodules)
  the development and maintenance of most of the modules we use.
- A VM was setup to run Jenkins, that should some day be an important
  part of [[todo/automated_builds_and_tests]].

Funding
=======

We have been working on starting our bounties program.
