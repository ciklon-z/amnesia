# What bridges are and when to use them

Any one able to observe your Internet connection's traffic (like your
Internet Service Provider, and perhaps even your government and law
enforcement agencies) can very easily see that you are using Tor in
its normal operation. This may be an issue if you live in a country
where

1. **Tor is censored (blocked):** Since Tails only allow anonymous
   Internet traffic through Tor, this would render Tails useless for
   everything except offline work with documents etc.

2. **using Tor is dangerous (or considered suspicious):** In this case simply
   starting Tails may get you into serious trouble.

Tor bridge relays (or just "bridges" for short) offer alternative
entry points to the Tor network, which makes it harder for your
Internet Service Provider to tell that you are using Tor.
If your situation fits into any of the ones described above
you should use Tor bridges in Tails. Please also read
The Tor Project's [dedicated page about
bridges](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges) to get a general
idea about what they are and how to get some bridges.

# How to use bridges in Tails

Tails tries to make it easier and safer to use bridges by providing a
*bridge mode* that forces Tor to only connect through bridges.
Furthermore, when *bridge mode* is activated Tails will guide you
through the process of setting up bridges as soon as the general
graphical user-interface has started. Note that you must have got hold
of the bridge information prior to this point and have them available
(e.g. written down on a piece of paper or stored in a
[[persistent document|doc/first_steps/persistence]]).

To activate Tails' *bridge mode*, add the <span
class="command">bridge</span> boot option in the <span
class="application">boot menu</span>. For detailed instructions, see
the documentation on
[[using the <span class="application">boot menu</span>|startup_options#boot_menu]].

# Some extra pointers if using Tor is dangerous in your country

The Tor Project's [documentation on
bridges](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges) mainly focuses on
censorship circumvention, i.e. the first situation we described
above. If the second situation applies to you, i.e. if using Tor is dangerous
in your country, then there are some extra rules you should follow in
order to stay as safe as possible. Please note that following these
rules doesn't give you absolute protection against being identified as
a Tor user.

* Always start Tails in "bridge mode".

* You should only use ["Obfuscated
  Bridges"](https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#PluggableTransports)
  since they are harder to identify than "normal" bridges.

* The more publicly unknown your bridges are, the better. The Tor
  Project distributes bridges in several very convenient ways
  (e.g. from their [website](https://bridges.torproject.org/) and via
  email). Unfortunately the issue with that approach is the
  *convenience*; whoever you are hiding from may have gotten the same
  bridge information by the same means. The Tor Project has some
  safeguards against that, but they are far from fool-proof.
  Therefore the best is if you can have a trusted friend or
  organisation in a different country run a "private" Obfuscated
  bridge for you. In this case "private" means that the bridge has the
  option `PublishServerDescriptor 0` set; without this option The Tor
  Project will learn about the bridge and may distribute it to others
  in the future, so it could end up in the hands of your adversary.
