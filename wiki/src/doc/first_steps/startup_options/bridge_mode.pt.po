"Tails tries to make it easier and safer to use bridges by providing a "
"*bridge mode* which forces Tor to only connect through bridges, so it will "
"never connect to the Tor network directly which otherwise would tell your "
"Internet Service Provider that you indeed are using Tor. Furthermore, when "
"*bridge mode* is activated Tails will guide you through the process of "
"setting up bridges as soon as the general graphical user-interface has "
"started. Note that you must have got hold of the bridge information prior to "
"this point and have them available (e.g. written down on a piece of paper or "

"The more publicly unknown your bridges are, the better. The Tor Project "
"distributes bridges in several very convenient ways (e.g. from their "
"[website](https://bridges.torproject.org/) and via email). Unfortunately the "
"issue with that approach is the *convenience*; whoever you are hiding from "
"may have gotten the same bridge information by the same means. The Tor "
"Project has some safeguards against that, but they are far from fool-proof.  "
"Therefore the best is if you can have a trusted friend or organisation in a "
"different country run a \"private\" Obfuscated bridge for you. In this case "
"\"private\" means that the bridge has the option `PublishServerDescriptor 0` "
"set; without this option The Tor Project will learn about the bridge and may "
"distribute it to others in the future, so it could end up in the hands of "
"your adversary."
