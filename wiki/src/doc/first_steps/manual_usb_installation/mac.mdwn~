<h2 class="bullet-number-one">Setup rEFInd</h2>

rEFInd will replace your original bootloader. If something goes wrong,
this could cause your Mac to not boot. It is recommended to create a full backup and know how to 
restore. See Apple's instructions [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1427).

You need to have [rEFInd](http://sourceforge.net/projects/refind/) installed and
working on the Mac.

If you need help with rEFInd, look at [their installation
documentation](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html).

<h2 class="bullet-number-two">Find out the device name of the USB stick</h2>

**Warning!** If you are not sure about the device name you should not proceed or **you risk
overwriting any hard drive on the system**.

The device name should be something like `/dev/disk1`, `/dev/disk2`, etc.

If you're not sure about the precise device name, do the following.

Unplug the USB stick.

Open Terminal from *Applications* → *Utilities* → *Terminal.app*:

Type the following command:

     diskUtil list

This will list all the current storage devices:

[[!img mac/diskUtil_list_empty_small.png link=no alt="Empty list"]]

Plug back the destination USB stick and run the same command as before:

	 diskUtil list

A new device should appear in the list of storage devices.
Check that the size of the device corresponds to your destination USB drive.
On this screenshot the USB drive is 4.0 GB and the location is /dev/disk1:

[[!img mac/diskUtil_list_USB_shows_small.png link=no alt="A new storage device appeared at the end of the list"]]

<a id="step_3"></a>

<h2 class="bullet-number-three">Unmount the USB drive</h2>

In the terminal window issue the following command, again replacing the destination
with the device name found in step 1.

     diskUtil unmountDisk [destination]

<h2 class="bullet-number-four">Get isohybrid.pl</h2>

4a - You need to modify the Tails ISO before installing it onto a USB stick.
     Download [syslinux](http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/s/syslinux/syslinux_4.02+dfsg.orig.tar.gz).
4b - Extract (double click) the package and copy isohybrid.pl from the /utils folder to your Desktop.
4c - Copy the tails image (tails-i386-0.17.1.iso) to your Desktop.

Now in your terminal window change directories into your Desktop

	cd Desktop

Now run the isohybrid.pl to prepare the tails image.

	perl isohybrid.pl tails-i386-0.17.1.iso --entry 4 --type 0x1c

Press enter and wait
<h2 class="bullet-number-five">Do the copy from the terminal.</h2>

In the terminal window issue the following command, replacing `[tails.iso]` by the path to the ISO
image that you want to copy and `[destination]` by the device name found in step
1.

	cat [tails.iso] > [destination] && sync

If you are not sure about the path to the ISO image or if you get a "No such
file or directory" error, you can first type `cat`, followed by a space, and
then drag and drop the icon of the ISO image from a file browser onto the
terminal. This should insert the correct path to the ISO image in the terminal.
Then type the rest of the command.

You should get something like this:

    cat tails-i386-0.17.1.iso > /dev/disk1 && sync

Press enter and wait
If you don't see any error message, Tails is being copied onto the key. The
whole process might take a while, generally a few minutes. Be patient…

<h2 class="bullet-number-six">Reboot your Mac</h2>


Wait for the rEFInd menu and select the USB drive to boot.

Notes
=====

This method was tested on a MacBookPro Model A1150 (year 2006)
running OSX 10.6.8

Note that Tails developers are in general not very knowledgeable about
Mac. Any additional information is welcome.


An alternative method was suggested:

1. Open Disk Utility
1. Find The Drive
1. Format Tab
1. Source is ISO File
1. Destination is USB Drive
