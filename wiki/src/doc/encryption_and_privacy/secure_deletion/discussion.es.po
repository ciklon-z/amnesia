"As far as I understand, the problems with secure deletion on flash/SSD are "
"mainly wear-leveling, burn-in, and making sure the reader supports the card "
"size. I'm not sure if there are also issues with drive caching and partition "
"alignment."

"Before you destroy the partition formatting or the partition table, it may "
"be necessary to make a note of how the drive was partitioned and formatted, "
"when you bought it, to ensure that you can recreate the proper partition "
"alignment. I don't understand this. It seems to be more of an issue with "
"\"solid state drives\" not USB flash drives/cards."

"If the flash drive has a partition table (usually they do appear in parted "

"overwriting the entire device, you may need the starting and ending sector "

"If you are only concerned about data that is on the partition(s), it seems "
"like all you need to do is encrypt the drive with something that overwrites "
"every bit with \"random\" data. Truecrypt containers/partitions are entirely "
"\"random\" so long as you do not \"quick format\" when you create the "
"container, you use a long \"random\" passphrase (of course you don't need to "
"remember it), and to be safe I would unmount the drive after each encryption "
"to ensure that it is finished writing and nothing has been cached (probably "
"unnecessary)."

"Encrypt the device a few times and maybe leave the last encryption to burn "
"in for a while before zeroing or formating unencrypted. Using the encrypted "
"device seems to be safest way to ensure that the overwritten data will not "
"be recoverable because the new encryption will have the longest time to burn "
"over the old data. If this is inconvenient, filling the device with large "
"files should reduce the amount of slack space where old data won't be "
"overwritten again."

"If you want to make sure you destoy data that could exist in the free space "
"outside the current partition, you will need to overwrite the entire "
"device. This seems more likely to mess up the drive's partition alignment "
"but I don't know. The procedure is the same as erasing a partition, except "
"for what is noted in the section \"Selecting to encrypt/erase partitions or "
"entire drives\"."
