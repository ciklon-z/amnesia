And the trolls strike again in comment 10. Please remember Tails devs that they are not really people or are paid for this purpose (and thus have a blackened soul). Such ad hominem atacks especially against tails devs probably have the purpose to lower your morale and polluting the forum for the users. A removal of comment 10 would be welcome and warranted imo.
