is this what you're looking for, my precious little smeagol?

tails (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Minor improvements
  - Replace the too-easy-to-misclick shutdown button with a better
    \"Shutdown Helper\" Gnome applet.
  - Display ~/Persistent in GNOME Places and GtkFileChooser if it is mounted.
  - Set Unsafe Browser's window title to \"Unsafe Browser\".
  - Install ekeyd to support the EntropyKey.
  - Install font for Sinhala.
  - Update Poedit to 1.5.4.
  - Kill Vidalia when restarting Tor.
    Doing this as early as possible exposes Vidalia's \"broken onion\" icon
    to users less.
  - Hide the persistence setup launchers in kiosk mode.
  - Add a shell library for Tor functions.
    These are shared among multiple of our scripts.
  - Install dictionaries for supported languages.
    Install hunspell dictionaries when possible,
    fall back on myspell ones else.

  * Bugfixes
  - Disable IPv6 on all network interfaces.
    This is a workaround for the IPv6 link-local multicast leak that was recently
    discovered. Tails has no local service that listens on IPv6, so there should be
    no regression, hopefully, unless one wants to play with OnionCat and VoIP,
    but those of us should know how to workaround this anyway.
  - live-persist: Fix variable mismatch, fixing probe white-list.
    Tails may previously have been able to list GPT partitions labelled
    \"TailsData\" on hard drives (!) as valid persistence volumes...
  - live-persist: Fix --media option when no devices are attached.
    Earlier, if it was set to e.g. 'removable-usb' and no USB storage was
    connected, $whitelistdev would be empty, which is interpreted like
    all devices are ok by the rest of the code.
  - Fix SCIM in the autostarted web browser: save IM environment variables
    to a file during Desktop session startup, and export them into the
    autostarted browser's environment.
  - Talk of DVD, not of CD, in the shutdown messages.
  - Make tordate work in bridge mode with an incorrect clock.
    When using a bridge Tor reports TLS cert lifetime errors (e.g. when
    the system clock is way off) with severity \"info\", but when no bridge
    is used the severity is \"warn\". tordate/20-time.sh depends on grepping
    these error messages, so we termporarily increase Tor's logging
    severity when using bridge mode. If we don't do this tordate will
    sleep forever, leaving Tor in a non-working state.
    Â· White-list root to use Tor's ControlPort.
    Â· Add logging for is_clock_way_off().
    Â· Remove Tor's log before time syncing.
      We depend on grepping stuff from the Tor log (especially for
      tordate/20-time.sh), so deleting it seems like a Good Thing(TM).
    Â· Stop Tor before messing with its log or data dir.
  - live-persist: limit searched devices the same way as live-boot.
    If no --media argument is specified, use live-boot's
    \"(live-media|bootfrom)=removable(|-usb)\" argument to limit devices
    searched for a persistent volume.
  - tails-greeter: do not pass media=removable to live-persist.
    Now that we have autodetection with kernel command-line,
    it should not be needed anymore.
  - Start memlockd after configuring it,
    instead of starting it before and restarting it after.
    This avoids running memlockd twice, and prevents other possibly
    surprising race-conditions.
    As a consequence, also have tails-sdmem-on-media-removal start after the
    memlockd service *and* tails-reconfigure-memlockd: to start the watchdog,
    we need memlockd to be properly configured *and* running.

  * iceweasel
  - Set iceweasel homepage to the news section on the Tails website.
    ... using the localized one when possible.
  - Hide the iceweasel add-on bar by default.
    Now that we don't want to ship the Monkeysphere addon anymore,
    that was the only one displayed in there, we can as well hide the whole bar.
  - Don't hide the AdBlock-Plus button in the add-on bar anymore. Now that
    we hide the whole addon bar, we can get rid of this old
    UX improvement.
  - Do not install a placeholder (fake) FireGPG iceweasel extension anymore.
    It was shipped from 0.10 (early 2012) to 0.15 (late November),
    so the migration period should be over now.
  - Don't install xul-ext-monkeysphere anymore.
    The implication of the current keyserver policy are not well
    understood, Monkeysphere is little used in Tails, and we're not sure
    anymore it would be our first bet for the web browser profile with no
    CA. Let's keep the various configuration bits (e.g. FoxyProxy,
    patching MSVA), though, so that advanced users who are used to have
    Monkeysphere in Tails just have to install the package.

  * Build system
  - Install the \"standard\" task with tasksel for better consistency in the
    Tails ISO images built in various environments.
  - Install p7zip-full. It's a dep by file-roller, but we explicily use it
    elsewhere, and it's better to be safe than sorry.
  - Remove pinning of libvpx0 to sid.
    This package is part of Squeeze, and not from testing/sid.
    We have been shipping the version from Squeeze for a while.
  - Remove config/chroot_local-packages/ from .gitignore.
    The documented way for \"external\" contributors to add custom packages
    is to put them in chroot_local-packages, and once we pull we import
    any such package into our APT repo and rewrite the
    history appropriately.
    Also, the ability to add packages in there and not see them in \"git
    status\" makes it very easy to build tainted ISO images with
    non-standard packages, which makes some of us fear can lead to hard to
    debug situations.
  - Make it clearer what can and cannot be done in terms of local packages.
