My friend Tails


Is this the right place to report a bug


The bug is that I am not actually tails


and a link to www..../evilisopretendofficial.exe or test this release candidate at www..../officiallookingtailsiso.iso would not be the best thing in the universe. a reminder to people they should be extensively verifying the tails signing key, and then cryptographically verifying tails .iso's


I need not explain this bug as it will become self evident giving enough looking at it ;)


Wishlist items:
Pretty please screenlocker and disabling ALT+F* ttys before version 2.0
Virtual tails within a tails-livecd (this is hard! i will work on this myself)
