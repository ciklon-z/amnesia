In Gparted, my USB drive has two partitions:
fat32 TAILS (boot flag) & crypt-luks

.13 was cloned over, from a running virtual machine of it, into the boot partition (overwriting).

For some reason I get a "missing operating system" message when trying to boot from USB on my PC-- which XP then boots.  Will try it on a different computer.
