>Tails must be doing somthing right...looks like the multitudes of privacy and security threats ie, government spies, hired mercs, etc., are frustrated- left to a pathetic spamming game! Keep up the good work Tails:)

The PLA (People's Liberation Army) of China, KGB of Russia, Kim Jong-un of North Korea, Bashir al-Assad of Syria and all the despots must be feeling the heat with the release of each iteration of Tails.

They have employed people with the ilk of comment 2 to spam this forum. That makes us all the more determined to promote the use of Tails among the oppressed in China, North Korea, Russia, Syria, etc.
