Yeah, right,

...and when you decide your car would have run better with a v8 than its straight 6 you whine and rant at your mechanic? Whining and ranting and badgering him relentlessly about how your car should have been designed. Badgering on and on at your mechanic, perhaps attracting the attention of a few of your cronies to form an angry mob on your mechanics forecourt. All whining and ranting at your mechanic until GM design you a v8.

Moron.
