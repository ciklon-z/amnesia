@ anyone who is comfortable emailing a post to Tor-talk:

On our behalf, please ask the Tor Project to create a forum like this one, *allowing posts by unregistered users* (on the grounds that if you don't keep user data, it can't be lost, stolen, or seized).

Please remind them that

* any Tor-related forum is likely to attract sophisticated attackers attempting Watering-Hole attacks on the Tor user base
* some of popular webforum softwares are full of unpatched security holes)

Thus, choice of forum software should be driven by two over-riding criteria:

* allows anonymous posting by unregistered users
* is easy to maintain/backup/restore and fairly simple/secure
