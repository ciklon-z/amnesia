this \"don't discuss Tor here\" crap is old.

when i take my car in for a fix, his eyes don't glaze over before he slams the lid shut, looks to you like fire is going to come from his lips and say, \"we don't discuss engines here.\"

if we shouldn't discuss Tor here, perhaps Tails is better without it and should try another system for anonymous use which can be discussed here openly.
