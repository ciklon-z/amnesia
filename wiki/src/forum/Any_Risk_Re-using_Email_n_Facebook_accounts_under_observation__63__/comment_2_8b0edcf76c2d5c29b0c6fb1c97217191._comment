>Is there any risk in using the same accounts despite knowing that yahoo and facebook are monitoring and observing those accounts and my government is hell bent upon tracing me?

You should switch to Google Mail immediately. Yahoo has a bad track record of turning in dissenters and protesters to hostile governments and harsh regimes. Four Chinese dissenters are still serving time in labour re-education camps in China while a fifth has just been released after having served 10 years', *no thanks to Yahoo*. Yahoo was summoned to appear before the US Congress to explain its despicable actions: \"Yahoo summoned to Washington over Chinese arrests\"

Summary: stop using Yahoo. Use Gmail.
