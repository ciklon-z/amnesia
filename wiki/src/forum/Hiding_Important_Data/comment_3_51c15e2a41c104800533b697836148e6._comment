Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is well suited for small encrypted files you may want to hide inside large innocuous not elsewhere published images.  This tool is not very easy to use but you can give it a try:

     http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/seccure

Also useful are utilities which can if neccessary convert an unpublished innocuous image you made or have at hand into png format, which can be used with steghide.

If you don't know how to \"live install\" or how to use the man page after you have done that to figure out how to use the package, ask.
