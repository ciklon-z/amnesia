> I have looked into steganography but read that it can easily be identified.

Not neccessarily true.  Depends upon circumstances.  

If you use a non-amnesiac OS, an adversary who has the opportunity to examine your hard drive at leisure and who suspects steganography will have a better chance of finding steganographically hidden information.

If you use an amnesiac OS such as Tails booted from a live DVD to post an innocuous image (especially one you made just for this purpose), a tool like steghide (which you can live install using synaptic on your Tails system booted from a live DVD) can be used to hide a small encrypted message.  In this case, an adversary who may not know which images to check and who has no comparision file (unmodified image file) may find it difficult to detect the presence of hidden information.
