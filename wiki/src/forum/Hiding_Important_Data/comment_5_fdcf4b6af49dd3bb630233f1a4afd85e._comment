Another issue raised by your post is the question of whether it is better to store sensitive material as an encrypted file \"in the cloud\" or in an encrypted USB stick, where these might be steganographically disguised.  

For concreteness, suppose someone living under a criminally corrupt regime has obtained a clandestine video of a human rights violation, and needs to try to store it safely while trying to arrange for its unsourced publication.  (A Tails user who faced such a problem posted not long ago in this forum.)

In such a case, the potential problems with storing anything (even steganographically disguised) in your home or on your person (e.g. an encrypted USB stick) are obvious.

But there are some serious problems with storing anything in the cloud:

* nothing you do in the cloud is under your control
* cloud storage companies may promise \"security\" but that may be an empty promise
* cloud storage companies may give in without protest to foreign government demands or even civil law threats to divulge your contact information and more
* if you keep in the cloud even the encryption keys for your encrypted files, you have no very good reason to believe that those keys will remain known only to yourself

One possible approach which you might consider is splitting up various pieces of what would be needed to reconstruct the sensitive information in various locations.  I tend to think that encryption and decryption is best done on a machine you control, but you could use Tails booted from a DVD with a very long key which you encrypt with a shorter seccure key, hide in an unpublished innocuous image using steghide with another short key, store the image in the cloud in some innocuous web account (many people use gaming accounts or silly on-line gambling accounts, which can suggest to authorities an obvious reason why you might seem a little nervous during interrogation, without neccessarily arousing suspicions of political dissidence), and then shred all the precursors from your Tails system just be safe.  You'll need to remember two shorter keys and you'll need to reverse steps if you need to recover the original file.
