What it is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrossOver_%28software%29


"CrossOver (a.k.a. CrossOver Office before version 6.0) is the collective name for two commercial and proprietary programs developed by CodeWeavers that allow many Windows-based applications to run on Linux and Mac OS X using a compatibility layer. The programs include CrossOver Mac and CrossOver Linux.


The programs are modified, proprietary versions of the public Wine source tree with various compatibility patches added, more user-friendly configuration tools, and commercial support. CodeWeavers employs several Wine developers and contributes code back to the free software/open-source software Wine project as per the GNU LGPL, although CrossOver is proprietary software."


On October 31, 2012, CodeWeavers will have a second software giveaway, this one entitled "Flock the Vote." CodeWeavers promised to have such a giveaway if 100,000 American voters would promise to vote on election day, in a nonpartisan bid to encourage activism. 100,000 people have pledged, so CodeWeavers will allow any person in the world to download and register a copy of CrossOver Linux or CrossOver Mac; the offer includes a year of support.
