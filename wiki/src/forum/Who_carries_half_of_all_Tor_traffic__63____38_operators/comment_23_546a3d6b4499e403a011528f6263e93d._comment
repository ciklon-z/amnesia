Recently EFF asked its members to create Tor relays using Amazon ECC, and there are indeed now quite a few such nodes operating.  But their total bandwidth is so small that few Tor circuits actually use them.

I think the Tor Project needs to focus on encouraging more (many more) medium bandwidth nodes and to actively discourage very high bandwidth nodes which grab a disproportionate amount of all the traffic (even worse, almost all of these are geolocated under the jurisdiction of the USA or its allies).

As you probably know, some recent academic papers support my finding that the mere fact that the Tor network continues to acquire more nodes has *not* helped to decrease a handful of operators from carrying more than half of all Tor traffic.  In some ways, the problem has gotten *worse*.

I have been unable to raise this issue with the Tor developers, but you can.
