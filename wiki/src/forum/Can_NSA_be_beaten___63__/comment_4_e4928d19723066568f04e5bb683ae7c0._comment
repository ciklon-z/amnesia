> Is it possible in the near future that community be able to provide protection methods even against an adversary like NSA?

No.

> and two: How can we ever know if NSA has -for example- broken AES in secret?

It's a meaningless question.

How can we ever proof the Illuminati, the Freemason, I or \<insert someone here\> have not broken \<name something inside here\> in secret?

> What about all the classified tools?

Classified tools?

> How can people ever know what these guys have achieved in the first place to be able to protect against it?

We can't. It's an arms race. NSA has won. We hopefully find out their abilities through whisteblowers, freedom of information act, court papers, press reports, common sense.

> How can open source ever beat NSA closed source? They can see you and your code but you cant do the same to them.

What do you suggest instead? Going closed source? There is no real alternative. Closed source poses a trust issue because only employed black hat read the disassembly.

There is no such thing as \"closed source\". There is only software available for everyone for download and in-house software. Even if Tails where closed source, they could still force people to look for issues by reading the disassembly. They do that by paying black hat to do that.

On the other white hat hackers are much more likely to cooperate fixing easily human readable source code. This is a fundamental argument security through obscurity vs openness.
