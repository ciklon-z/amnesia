Glad to see you are consistent.

But since you didn't go so far as to remove a comment presenting the dismal view that \"resistance is futile\", I hope you won't remove a rejoinder stating that some informed participants believe that the correct short answer to the question asked is:

@ OP:

Yes, the NSA can be beaten, or at least forced to stop trying to spy on absolutely everyone absolutely all of the time, and there are measures we can all take which work towards that goal.  Unfortunately we are not permitted to discuss here what these might be.  Search for NDI to learn one possible reason why not.
