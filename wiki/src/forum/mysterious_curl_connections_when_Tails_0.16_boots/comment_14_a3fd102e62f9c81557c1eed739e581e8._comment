Hello! =) I'm trying to resolve the issue.
The network has a lot of different portals with figures for the PC. These wallpapers are in the public domain. You can upload at least some in different formats<a href=http://medbun.ru/pages-more-1526.html>.</a> Let's say I want to open a small shop and do a site of this store. then take some of these oboin , edit, cut a piece of , say horizon, and upload to your web site .
Will this be a violation of copyright? If you think the picture is in the public domain and I take only a piece of the whole picture. I just extract profits from the pictures .Whether the right of the action to make a complaint ? If so, who? Does this fall under the category of violations of the law ?
Thanks in advance if anyone can help to understand this :)
