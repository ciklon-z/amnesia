> I think we have decided to disclose them in our finances reports when we're allowed to (else, conspirano√Øacs will no doubt imagine the worse they can -- on their own scale of what's better and worse)

This bullshit remark suits your amateurish level pretty well. No one serious implied conspiracies when discussing your lack of funding info. However, your indiscriminate approach to funding sources shows your lack of principles, and hiding their names with silly Alpha/Bravo/Charlie nicks demonstrates teenage stupidity and willingness to play secret games. Also, lack of spending details is easy to understand in light of, for instance, that gettogether for all your 10 or so useless devs, which was a complete money waste obviously.
