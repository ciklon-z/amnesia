Your assumption is wrong. Doing evil things to privacy does result in significant humiliation and loss of trust/business. Recent events re. Barracuda, RIM, Actel/Microsemi, etc, and u-turns re. ToS by Google, Facebook and friends should illustrate that, even to you. Furthermore, as you're aware, it's the very reason people like you are here, making a nuisance of themselves.

Your strange position re. \"open source\" is irrelevant. One wouldn't need to decompile anything if one had access to the source and toolchain!

*Please* stop wasting your, and more importantly, others' time with this stuff and respect comment 3.
