I'm having trouble too.

Some possibly unhelpful comments:

* Tails 0.17 is out
* in trying to figure out strange events and other problems, I have the strong impression that several third parties with strong/weak ties to Tails are doing things which are affecting surfing with Tails, including something mysterious but presumably helpful Jacob A is doing for Tor (censorship research), and some mysterious and probably unhelpful things Google and Cymru and some content delivery networks are doing under guise of anti-APT1, anti-malware, or anti-piracy US government \"information-sharing\" measures
* what is the locale setting in your Tails browser?  did you use Vidalias \"network map\" to check that you were using a Russian exit server when you say the Cyrillic news?   I think your locale should be english-us by default in which case you should be sent to English langage news items by Google.  If your real language is Russian and you still get Cyrillic that could mean that Google knows your true location at least up to region.
