> (...) Unfortunately, that thread was deleted, as was a previous version of this thread.

It was deleted because it has no connection to Tails, the OS, and this thread is going to get deleted for the same reason, you have been told this before but you seem to have a really hard time understanding the message, this forum is for Tails specific discussion, discussion of other projects like Tor does not belong here.

Please take this Tor discussion and to a place actually intended for Tor discussion, continuing to spam this forum will lead you nowhere.
