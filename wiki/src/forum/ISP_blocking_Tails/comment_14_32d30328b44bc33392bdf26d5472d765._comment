If you haven't seen it, search for 

* recent report on Gamma malware being used to target dissidents from a group of Canadian researchers
* Bloomberg News series \"Wired for Repression\"
* analysis at OWNI
* analysis at Privacy International

High bandwidth Tor routers have sometimes been associated in the past, including the recent past, with unethical \"research\" targeting Tor users.  I urge everyone to keep an eye on your Tor circuits over time and to try to educate yourself how Tor circuits are currently built (entry guards, rotations, and the dangers of entry-exit node confirmation attacks).
