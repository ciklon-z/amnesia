Thanks, much appreciated!

Better run and grab a copy of comment 8 in

    https://tails.boum.org/forum/Who_is_Sponsor_Bravo__63__/

before it is deleted.  This post contains verifiable information which may explain why the moderator at this website tends to react badly to any comment which

* expresses criticism of the international privatisation of government and other policies pursued by CIPE (one of the four \"core grantees\" of NED; another, NDI, has given some financial support to the Tails Project)
* expresses criticism of policies followed by President Obama, Attorney General Holder, or other leading members of the current majority party in the US (NDI is affiliated with the Democratic Party)
* attempts to explain how to evade scrutiny by US intelligence agencies, or targeting by drones (NED is said by some to derive from CIA antecedents; certainly it was born in the miasma of \"Iran Contra\" and seems to still retain a whiff of the stench from that business)
* expresses criticism of \"Team Thetis\" (CIPE is affiliated with the US Chamber of Commerce, which allegedly helped found \"Team Thetis\" in order to spy on labor organizers, the Occupy Movement, and other perceived \"enemies\" of Wall Street)
* attempts to debunk the fallacy of \"American exceptionalism\"
* attempts to criticize any aspect of US foreign policy or Israeli foreign policy

So I'll do my best, when I get a chance, but the post probably won't be up very long.
