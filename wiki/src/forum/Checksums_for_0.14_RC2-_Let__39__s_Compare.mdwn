Yes, I know, checksums *alone* cannot verify authenticity. But they can be somewhat useful as *one* of *several* indicators....and since *no* method alone can truly be 100% failsafe, etc....

(If a consensus and built and someone finds their sums differing from the consensus, then it would be cause for concern)

So let's compare our checksums for 
**tails-i386-0.14~rc2.iso**

Here are the **SHA256** sums I got:

*Before* running the `isohybrid` command (in order to manually install to USB drive; exact command is: `isohybrid tails-i386-0.14~rc2.iso --entry 4 --type 0x1c`):
`22a25e2c743993ab89e1d74abcfee6d8fab7ac8cc8265049e998f6861ecb4b77`

*After* running said `isohybrid` command:
`5cb6d273709a77d523bec7b0664e74738e3afd8720e6bb5ae4c117a01bdd20dc`
