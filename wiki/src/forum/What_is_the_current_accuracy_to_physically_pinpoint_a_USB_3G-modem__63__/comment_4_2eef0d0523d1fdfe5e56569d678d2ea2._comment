Your information on the accuracy is outdated.

Based on what I was told by an informant working at Unit 61398 of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, located on the outskirts of Shanghai, the NSA of USA together with Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Apple and Google+ got together last week to discuss the implementation of a revolutionary new technology that is able to pinpoint a user's current location with an accuracy of about 1 meter. It does not have to rely on a targeted person(s) having to use a USB 3G modem.
