Is it possible that they catch 3G radiosignals with satellites and based upon that they can locate the signal more accurate?

What I have gathered the most accurate pinpointing of radiosignals is still with an error of minimum 50 meters. I'm not sure whether they can pinpoint a 3G USB-modem within 3 meters. In well populated areas many devices, signals and frequencies also jam/weaken eachother and maybe that is also a thing to take into consideration.
