From what I gather, the Americans are able to pinpoint your location within 3 meters.

If you are a member of the following organizations or attempt to communicate with them via USB 3G modem:

1. Al Qaeda
2. Taleban
3. Hezbollah
4. Muslim Brotherhood
5. Hamas
6. Boko Haram

(or any terrorist organisation as listed in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_designated_terrorist_organizations )

you can be sure of a drone attack initiated by the Americans.

Plus, it was revealed by President Obama last week that any American who carries out terrorist attacks outside of USA will face the same punishment as the Jihadists.
