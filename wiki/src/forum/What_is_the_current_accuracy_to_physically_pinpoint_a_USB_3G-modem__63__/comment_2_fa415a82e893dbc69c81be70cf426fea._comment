I'd be very interested in this as well. I already use a prepaid anonymous 3G modem, which I use only with tails, where I change both the sim and modem periodically. People seem to sniff at this, but at least this is deniable- your name linked to an ISP contract is not. Comment 1 sounds like a troll.
