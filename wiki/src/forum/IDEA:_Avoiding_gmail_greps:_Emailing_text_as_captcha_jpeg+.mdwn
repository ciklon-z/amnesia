I just had a privacy idea I wanted to run by you:

IDEA:
Emailing an image of message text. This text would be your email
message. But by sending it as a black & white image file, you avoid
gmail (and all the other slightly psychotic data hoarders) from using
grep functions to scan all our emails.

PROS:
No exchange of keys necessary or encryption plugins needed.
Thus, for the email recipient it is very user-friendly.

CONS:
Its far from ideal privacy but is a definite spanner in the works!

FURTHER IDEA:
A thunderbird plugin to do this would be good :-)
A slight captcha adjustment to the image would spin out gmail robots
even more!
I came across this command to convert text to .gif at: http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/4943/convert-text-to-picture
echo -e "Some Text Line1\nSome Text Line 2" | convert -background none -density 196  -resample 72 -unsharp 0x.5 -font "Courier" text:- -trim +repage -bordercolor white -border 3  text.gif

QUESTIONS:
Has someone already come up with this idea?
If not, where do you think would be a good place to bring this idea up
for discussion? 
Can you recommend any command line kung fu to convert txt to jpeg?

Let me know what you think.
