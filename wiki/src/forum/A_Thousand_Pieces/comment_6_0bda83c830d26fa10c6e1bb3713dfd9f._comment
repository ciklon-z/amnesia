In the end we always get to this point don't we?
Users have different needs and different views as to how things should be run which often coincides with the user personal interests.
There are two ways to solve this: 
1) Tails calls the shots and that's it, it's tails forum ultimately they make the rules and the rest take them or leave it - somewhat dictatorial but that's life.
2) Moderation - Privacy-minded individuals start to label their threads as oriented (though still related to tails OS) towards the global picture and the users who don't care can avoid such treads. (privacy minded individuals could also refrain from posting walls of text and going more to the point could also help - I doubt many read such comments as they are so it's kind of counterproductive)
