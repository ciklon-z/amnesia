If you want to make posts here which don't have an obvious relation to technical problems involved in using Tails, I think you should try much harder to explain why you think your discussion belongs in the Tails forum.

I read enough about privacy issues, corporate malfeasance, and Red Scare history to understand the allusions in the quotations you posted (unfortunately not well sourced), and I think I can see why you thought these quotes would be of interest to Tails users.  But as people post increasingly oblique threads here, it becomes more and more likely that \"Tails\" will feel compelled to close the forum, or to change to a more easily hacked but more easily moderated forum software in order to prevent people from posting threads \"Tails\" thinks are too \"off topic\".

I'd like to try post threads on issues which I think are directly relevant to Tail usage, although neccessarily embracing socio-political as well as technical points, because in my opinion it is impossible to use Tails properly unless you understand the political/legal environment as well as technical threats.  I'd like to explain why I feel that all Tor users (and thus all Tails users) should probably begin now to operate under the assumption that it is just a matter of time before their PC/laptop/phone is subjected to some kind of warrantless search and seizure, and follow up with an exploration of commonly misunderstood issues related to the security of SSD drives with respect to wipe/shred, encryption, and so forth.

Just as an example of the kind of possible future thread I don't want to see suppressed here.
