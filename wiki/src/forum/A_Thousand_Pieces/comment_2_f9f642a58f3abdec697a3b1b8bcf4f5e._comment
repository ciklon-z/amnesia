>and follow up with an exploration of commonly misunderstood issues related to the security of SSD drives with respect to wipe/shred, encryption, and so forth.

There seems to be a terrible lack of clarity when it comes to encryption for solid state media (SSDs, SD cards, USB flash sticks, a.k.a., \"thumb drives\").

The TrueCrypt documentation explicitly recommends *against* using such media for the creation of TrueCrypt volumes. Others echo this as well.

Yet, Tails, most other GNU/Linux documentation that I've seen appears and countless other sources appear to simply assume and take it as a given that properly implemented encryption (whether LUKS, TrueCrypt, GPG or other) is just as effective on solid state media as it is on any other.  

(Also, the Tails documentation on creating a LUKS volume has no mention of the need to fill the device with at least pseudo-*random data* first.)
