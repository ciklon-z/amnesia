@ OP:

We are talking about an organization which emails in clear text passwords to people who sign up for its recruitment website, and which pays them so poorly that it allows, even encourages, its employees to moonlight, plying their skills on behalf of corporations who desire to mount \"information operations\" against union organizers and corprorate whistleblowers (for example).  An organization which admitted failure in its attack on a message encrypted in a British cipher (fine if encrypted using a one-time pad as they concluded, but the statistics of the message cast doubt upon that claim, suggesting instead a digraphic cipher with some transpositions).

Government crypto organizations *can* be thwarted if we are determined, resolute, and use our hive mind to think up schemes which they have not considered.
