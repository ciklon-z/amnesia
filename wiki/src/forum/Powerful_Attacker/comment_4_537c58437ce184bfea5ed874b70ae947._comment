Wouldn't it better serve the OP and the community of Tails users to cite an on-line document, such as this 2010 survey paper?

     Recent Attacks on Tor
     Juha Salo
     cse.tkk.fi/en/publications/B/11/papers/salo.pdf 

(Anyone know of a more recent survey paper?)

Many of the papers cited by Salo can be found in

     http://freehaven.net/anonbib/

(Which should really be in the Tails bookmarks.)
