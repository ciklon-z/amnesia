My friend Tails

Is this the right place to report a bug

The bug is that I am not actually tails

and a link to www..../evilisopretendofficial.exe or test this release candidate at www..../officiallookingtailsiso.iso would not be the best thing in the universe. a reminder to people they should be extensively verifying the tails signing key, and then cryptographically verifying tails .iso's

I need not explain this bug as it will become self evident giving enough looking at it ;)

Wishlist items: Pretty please screenlocker and disabling ALT+F* ttys before version 2.0 Virtual tails within a tails-livecd (this is hard! i will work on this myself)


dont download www.evilh4x0r/This_Is_Official_Tails_ISO.iso

DO learn GnuPG well
