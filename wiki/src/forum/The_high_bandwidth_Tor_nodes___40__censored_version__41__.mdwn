In a previous thread in this forum

     https://tails.boum.org/forum/Who_carries_half_of_all_Tor_traffic__63____38_operators/

it was explained that

* Tor clients build circuits by choosing 3 nodes, where the likelihood of each node being chosen is roughly proportional to its "official bandwidth"
* About three dozen "operators" (a term whose meaning was explained in the thread) carried just over half of all Tor traffic in late January 2013
* This circumstance greatly increases the likelihood of successful correlation attacks which attempt to denanonymize Tor users by monitoring both the entry and exit node used in a given Tor circuit

Another thread in this forum attempted to explain the statistical facts of life concerning the "predecessor attack", a kind of "correlation attack" mentioned in the Tor FAQ.  The discusson, which included an estimate of the time required to deanonymize all "unlucky" Tor users, among the population which use Entry Guards (the default method for entering the Tor network), was based upon a research paper which was recently cited by "Tails" in this forum.  Unfortunately, that thread was deleted, as was a previous version of this thread.

As of mid-March 2013, half of all Tor traffic is carried by just 41 domains:

First column: bandwidth in KB/sec.  Second: number of nodes.  Third: domain (or in one case where registration was ambiguous, an IP range).

There are a few newcomers to the roster of big bandwidth Tor nodes, but the majority of operators are already familiar from the previous thread.   The national breakdown is similar that previously reported.

There is something very interesting (many things, actually) about one of the newcomers, but it seems that revealing this is not allowed in this forum.  Too bad, because it sheds a fascinating light on the nature of life under the shadow of the predatory Surveillance State.
