There is even a rumor that one of the memos presents arguments for the \"legality\" of taking out a national electrical grid, even knowing that this will disable hospitals, water and sewage, and other services which are essential for citizens, especially citizens caught up in a war.

Of course, it is not hypothetical to think the US government might attack a national electrical grid, because they have done it before.  What is different now is that the latest techniques are so much more devastating.
