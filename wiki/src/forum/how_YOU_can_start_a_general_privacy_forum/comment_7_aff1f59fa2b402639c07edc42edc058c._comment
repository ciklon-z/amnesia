> in the real world, Tor must be viewed as a \"mature project\". Real people are really using Tor in some very dangerous places to do some very dangerous things. The Tor Project certainly knows this, but they haven't yet drawn the inference that this means they need to put more effort into educating those potential users most at risk about how to use \"the Tor that we have\".

Put another way, the Tor Project should recall that Gen. Washington once won a rather important war by seeing how he could use the resources he had to realize his goals.  And he defeated the reigning superpower, by recognizing that he enjoyed novel but intrinsic advantages in the struggle, while his adversary, however fearsome its reputation, suffered from certain intrinsic weaknesses.

In the same way, it is by recognizing and exploiting the intrinsic weaknesses of our own adversaries that we can break the back of the Surveillance State.  This is another reason why developers of privacy-promoting software hamstring their potential whenever they insist upon disregarding any strategic considerations, on the grounds that strategy is \"political\".
