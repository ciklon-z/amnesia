> OP, I just went to your first suggested alternative (onion forum) to discussing Tails and related issues here on the Tails forum. And I was the one and ONLY PERSON ONLINE!

>And besides the extreme low activity of this forum that was FAR too low to keep a serious ongoing discussion going. It was also almost completely about unrelated things, such as \"deaf asian girlfriend\", \"how to poison someone\" and other things I won't even mention.

You are braver than I, but this is exactly what I expected: that the only people who visit the named forums are police and... people or robots with agendas unrelated to Tor.

Amen to all that.

I do agree with what the Tails developers said about the problem lying with the Tor developers, who clearly should take the lead in finding some way to set up (and heres the enduring problem, to *moderate*) the lacking forum.

It occurs to me that one way of characterizing the problem is that I think that the Tor Project still tends to think of itself as an \"academic testing project\", but that is wrong.  From the viewpoint of software theory, Tor is indeed primitive (anything using TLS v.0 should be called \"primitive\"), but in the real world, Tor must be viewed as a \"mature project\".  *Real people are really using Tor in some very dangerous places to do some very dangerous things*.  The Tor Project certainly knows this, but they haven't yet drawn the inference that this means they need to put more effort into educating those potential users most at risk about how to use \"the Tor that we have\".  

Even worse, the roster of what actions are dangerous, what places are dangerous, and who is at risk appears to be continually expanding.  I feel that even non-US citizens should very carefully study the one memo which has so far been released (by NBC News, who got it as a leak, not by the US executive) detailing the current US governments own view of its supposed \"legal justification\" for such extreme violations of international law and their own constitution as raids inside nuclear armed countries, and un-nameable officials acting as judge, jury, and executioner in the infamous and ever more routine \"drone strikes\".  This the already infamous memo which summarizes longer memos which lay out the case for the supposed legality of the extrajudicial execution by drone strike of targeted American citizens.

And I think US citizens should very carefully consider that they do not in fact have a monopoly on this technology.  Their government is setting a terrible precedent which other nations (and no doubt, NGOs like Hamas) will soon follow.  The latest generation of lethal drones are quite literally backportable assasination drones which will make perfect methods for (genuine) certain NGOs once they acquire this technology, which is not beyond the ability of knowledgeable individuals acting alone to reproduce.  Drone technology is inherently \"leveling\", which makes the American reliance upon it appear even more insanely self-injurious.

One particularly chilling sentence in the one memo so far released has been largely overlooked:

> this paper does not attempt to determine the minimum requirements necessary to render [a \"lethal operation outside the United States against a U.S. citizen who is\" a suspected terrorist] lawful, nor does it assess might be required to render a lethal operation against a U.S. citizen lawful in other circumstances.

This seems to suggest that the missing memos, or future memos of the same ilk, will suggest \"legal arguments\" which supposedly \"justify\" other kinds extrajudicial extraterritorial executions targeting other kinds of persons.

In our brave new world, *all citizens everywhere are increasingly at risk from all governments everywhere*, and it only makes things worse when the self-declared \"leader of the free world\" is advocating for the proposition that any nation can declare itself free to kill its way out of any problem (such as political unrest).

Eric Schmidt (not my favorite person) likes to say: \"Privacy is dead, get over it\".  And it seems that the U.S. government is telling us: \"Legality is dead, and soon so will be anyone who has a problem with that\".
