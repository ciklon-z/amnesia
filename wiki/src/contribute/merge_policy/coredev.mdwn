[[!meta title="Git merge policy: core developer"]]

All development should happen in topic branch. For a new feature XXX, it sould
be named `feature/XXX`. For a bugfix about YYY, it should be name `bugfix/YYY`.
When the developer thinks it is good enough and has tested it, she must:

- tag the ticket `todo/qa`
- ask the Release Managers to review and merge (in devel generally, in testing
  or stable) for bugfixes by sending an email to the `tails-dev@boum.org`
  mailing list
