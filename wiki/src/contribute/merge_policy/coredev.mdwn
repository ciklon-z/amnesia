[[!meta title="Git merge policy: core developer"]]

All development should happen in topic branches. For a new feature XXX, it should
be named `feature/XXX`. For a bugfix about YYY, it should be name `bugfix/YYY`.
When the developer thinks it is good enough and has tested it, she must:

- merge the topic branch into the `experimental` one
- tag the ticket `todo/qa`
- ask the Release Managers to review and merge (in devel generally, in testing
  or stable for bugfixes) by writing to the `tails-dev@boum.org`
  mailing-list
