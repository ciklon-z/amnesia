<p>I'd like to see TAILS offer persistence for bookmarks and settings. This might be accomplished with a small encrypted file that TAILS could read in once the correct password had been given. The file could be kept on a separate drive such as a flash memory card.

<p>Personally I would prefer not to have to set the mouse to left-handed every time I need to reboot, and having to either memorize or save, copy and paste URLs every time I need to visit a site.

<p>If most of this could be done automatically, that would be a bonus - but anything would be appreciated.

<p>Thanks for making this great program available to us!
