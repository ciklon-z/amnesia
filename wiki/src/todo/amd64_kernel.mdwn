When the VirtualBox bugs about guest additions vs. 32-bit userspace
+ 64-bit kernel is fixed, reconsider shipping an amd64 kernel, and
replacing sdmem with memtest.

Until then, ship a amd64 kernel, don't boot it, only use it for
kexec'ing to memtest.

An amd64 kernel should support being able to run virtualisation software within tails AFTER booting tails from a live cd on the bare hardware.

This would allow user choice of guest OS (perhaps residing in their persistence storage)



Virtualisation would among other things allow two features for users:
* Run tails within tails and enforce tor-only connections of inner tails (the virtual machine) even if an attacker got root in the virtual machine. Attacker would have to user additional exploit(s) to break out of a virtual machine
* Enable the hide hardware serial numbers feature by being inside a virtual machine, an attacker with root or user privileges would not be able to read hardware serial numbers like processor serial number, or on many computers factory globally unique UUID. These serial numbers in some cases are able to be traced back to the purchaser of the hardware. 
* Many flexible use cases for running a virtual machine within tails-livecd
