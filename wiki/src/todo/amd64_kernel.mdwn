When the VirtualBox bugs about guest additions vs. 32-bit userspace
+ 64-bit kernel is fixed, reconsider shipping an amd64 kernel, and
replacing sdmem with memtest.

Until then, ship a amd64 kernel, don't boot it, only use it for
kexec'ing to memtest.

An amd64 kernel should support being able to run virtualisation software within tails AFTER booting tails from a live cd on the bare hardware.

This would allow user choice of guest OS (perhaps residing in their persistence storage)
