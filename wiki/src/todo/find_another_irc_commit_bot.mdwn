[CIA.vc is
dead](http://shadowm.rewound.net/blog/archives/245-CIA.vc-is-dead.html). It
would be good to find another way to have commits announced to the IRC
channels.

`repo.or.cz` which was used to send updates to CIA is also able to trigger
HTTP post compatible with HTTP post compatible with [GitHub
webhooks](https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks).
[gitbot](https://github.com/thedjinn/gitbot) is a fairly trivial bot
written in Ruby that receives these kind of commit notifications and
write them on an IRC channel.

Other options: [irker](http://www.catb.org/esr/irker/) and
[KGB](http://kgb.alioth.debian.org/). Both needs to be able to set custom
post-receive hooks in the repository. This is not the easiest as our
repositories are currently hosted by boum.org and immerda.ch.

[[!taglink todo/wait]] for a server to either host a gitbot,
or the whole set of our own Git repositories.
