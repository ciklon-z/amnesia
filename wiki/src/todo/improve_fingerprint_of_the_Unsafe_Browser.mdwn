For the WiFi hotspot and probably ISP, the recommended way of using
the Unsafe browser only to login in the portal and then use only Tor
is fingerprintable.

What clearnet request do people do to get the captive portal?

Can we improve the network fingerprint of that principal usecase?

As a first step, we wanted to make the Unsafe Browser look like
a default Debian Iceweasel ESR.
This was done by removing all add-ons.
