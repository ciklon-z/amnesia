Could GPG be modified to support keys greater than 4096?

Currently in tails if gpg is run in --expert mode the max key size that can be created is 4096 bit.  As I am creating a long term off line key, I would have like to be able to create 8192 bit master key.

>>> Yes.

>>>>> "*Could GPG be modified to support keys greater than 4096?*" ...yes! It's actually surprisingly trivial to modify gnupg's source to this end *yourself*. The resulting keys are handled properly by unmodified compilations, so you needn't wait! I certainly don't think there's any justification for Tails to embark on propagating this sort of escapade unilaterally though. ;o)
