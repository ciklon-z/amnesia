Could GPG be modified to support keys greater than 4096?

Currently in tails if gpg is run in --expert mode the max key size that can be created is 4096 bit.  As I am creating a long term off line key, I would have like to be able to create 8192 bit master key.

> I'd rather see this fixed upstream and/or in Debian than diverging.
