We have decided to lock-down this website a bit. This will be
authorized:

- anonymous random edits on [[bugs]], [[todo]] and [[forum]]
- editing any part of the website: Tails core developers

`locked_pages` should become something like:

	! (bugs/* or todo/* or forum/*)

# Next things to do

* test this locally, then ask <root@boum.org> to apply it to our
  online wiki.
* document the new translation process on the
  [[contribute/how/translate]] page [[!tag todo/documentation]]

# Another thing to do

* [Dear Tails{} I wish to report a bug](https://tails.boum.org/forum/DEAR_TAILS__123____125___I_WISH_TO_REPORT_A_BUG_/)

[[!tag todo/website todo/easy]]
