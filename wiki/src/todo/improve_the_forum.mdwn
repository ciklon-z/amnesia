Let's switch to a more advanced Question & Answer webapp instead!
=================================================================

Required features
-----------------

- Allow to vote for the answers and display the answer sorted by votes.
- Allow to ask questions anonymously.
- Handle karma for logged in users.
- Have decently smart email notifications.
- By default, proposes to search before asking a new question.

OSQA
----

We decided to go for [OSQA](http://osqa.net/):

  - Django application.
  - Shows the ‘Search’ button first by default and the ‘Ask a question’
    button on the side.
  - Easy to install: checkout the source code, install all the
    dependencies from Debian: `python-django-south python-django
    python-django-debug-toolbar python-markdown python-html5lib
    python-openid` (instead of using easy_install), configure the
    desired server to use WSGI, create the DB and that's it.
    <http://wiki.osqa.net/display/docs/Ubuntu+with+Apache+and+MySQL>
  - We will host it under http://tails.boum.org/ask/.

Here is a list of other candidates, and the reason they were discarded:

  - [Askbot](http://askbot.org/), another Django webapp, but a pain to
    install, many dependencies outside of Debian, many issues on
    database support and migration during installation.
  - None of them allowed anonymous posting.
  - [Q2A](http://www.question2answer.org/), PHP + MySQL without
    dependencies, but with fewer features, and the ‘Ask a question’ was
    advertised before the ‘Search’ functionality.
  - [Shapado](http://shapado.com), written in Ruby, seems to be a pain
    to install, and maintain, or get hosted, see [[!debbug 633407]],
    shows the ‘Ask a question’ first and the ‘Search’ form in the top
    bar.
  - [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit/reddit), not really Q&A.

Things left to be done
----------------------

  - Remove connections to Google API. Replace the usage of external
    jqueryui to one we host ourselves, see
    <http://jira.osqa.net/browse/OSQA-814>.
  - Document the search engine issue at installation.
    If the permission to create TRIGGER is not grant, run
    `forum_modules/mysqlfulltext/fts_install.sql` by hand as root.
  - Remove ‘Reliable OSQA Hosting’ from the sidebar.
  - Customize the CSS to fit in the website.
  - Discuss whether OSQA should be better linked from the homepage.
    [[!tag todo/discuss]]
  - Add a ‘hardware’ tag.
  - Encourage people to use the appropriate ways to report bugs, and
    get getter support this way, proposal:
    “You are much more likely to get help with hardware related issues,
    and bugs, if you report them using WhisperBack. See
    [[doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]]".
  - Make the submission of an email optional when registering.
  - Get the source code in a Git repository using `git-svn`.
