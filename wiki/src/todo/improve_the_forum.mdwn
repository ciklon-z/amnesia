[[!toc levels=2]]

Let's switch to a more advanced Question & Answer webapp instead!
=================================================================

Required features
-----------------

- Allow to vote for the answers and display the answer sorted by votes.
- Allow to ask questions anonymously.
- Handle karma for logged in users.
- Have decently smart email notifications.
- By default, proposes to search before asking a new question.

OSQA
----

In the end OSQA might not be the good solution.

  - They did [some releases](http://www.osqa.net/blog/) quite quickly
    between 2010 and March 2011, but nothing since then.
  - The [developers mailing
    list](http://lists.osqa.net/pipermail/lists.osqa.net/dev/) has been
    almost dead since the last release.
  - There are [some](https://github.com/BinaryRage/OSQA/commits/master)
    [people](https://github.com/cdman/OSQA/commits/master) still
    developing it somehow on github though not on a regular basis.
  - People working on OSQA started their own business with
    [Answerhub](http://answerhub.com/). And it seems like they are not
    really working on OSQA anymore.
  - Officially they are still supporting OSQA, and there indeed are some
    recent commits in the subversion but way less than before: 510
    (2011), 60 (2012).

At first, we selected OSQA for the following reasons:

  - Django application.
  - Shows the ‘Search’ button first by default and the ‘Ask a question’
    button on the side.
  - Easy to install: checkout the source code, install all the
    dependencies from Debian: `python-django-south python-django
    python-django-debug-toolbar python-markdown python-html5lib
    python-openid` (instead of using easy_install), configure the
    desired server to use WSGI, create the DB and that's it.
    <http://wiki.osqa.net/display/docs/Ubuntu+with+Apache+and+MySQL>
  - We will host it under http://tails.boum.org/ask/.

Askbot
------

  - <http://askbot.org/>
  - Another Django webapp, forked from OSQA.
  - <https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel>
  - Has [many dependencies](https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/blob/master/askbot_requirements.txt) outside of Debian:
    - akismet
    - coffin
    - django-keyedcache
    - django-robots
    - django-kombu
    - django-followit
    - django-recaptcha-works
    - markdown2
    - pystache
    - pytz
    - longusername
  - The test installation did not succeeded because of many issues on
    database support, and migration during installation.
  - Most of the development is [done by 2
    people](https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/graphs/contributors),
    they are also selling it as a service.
  - The commit count looks promising: 393 (2009), 594 (2010), 1249
    (2011), 1106 (2012)
  - Bug tracker: <http://bugs.askbot.org/projects/askbot/>, but are they
    really using it?

### Features

  - Anonymous posting: like for OSQA, filling up the email field is
    required but the validity of the email is not checked.
  - Email notifications:
    - *Asked by me*
    - *Answered by me*
    - *Individually selected*
    - *Entire forum (tag filtered)*
    - *Comments and posts mentioning me*
  - Shows the ‘Search’ button first by default and the ‘Ask your
    question’ button on the side.
  - The software is
    [translated](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/askbot/) but there
    is no multilingual support from the web interface.
  - No group feature.

Shapado
-------

  - <http://shapado.com>
  - Written in Ruby
  - <https://gitorious.org/shapado>
  - Seems to be a pain to install, and maintain, or get hosted, see
    [[!debbug 633407]]
  - Developers tools: IRC channel, bug tracking through questions on
    Shapado.com.
  - Pivotal Tracker, but not used anymore?
    <https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/74584#>
  - Most of the development is done by 3 people, probably the people
    behind <http://ricodigo.com/>, the company running shapado.com.
  - Last release in September 2011, and no official release since then.
    The commit count dropped, but there is still recent activity: 730
    (2009), 2276 (2010), 1832 (2011), 344 (2012)

### Features

  - Anonymous posting:
    - Like for OSQA, filling up the email field is required but the
      validity of the email is not checked.
    - Setting `Enable Anonymous` for a group, but that only allows
      people logged in to answer a question without showing their
      username.
  - Email notifications:
    - *Get email notifications for new answers*
    - *Receive email notifications about questions in your field of
      expertise*
    - *Receive email notifications about system activities such as
      earned badges, new followers, etc*
    - *Receive a report with latest group activity (only for group
      admins)*
  - Shows the ‘Ask a question’ first and the ‘Search’ form in the top
    bar.
  - Group feature:
    - User can join different groups with a single login.
    - I don't think it is possible to move questions to another group
  - Multilingual support with user settings such as:
    - *Language used for the interface of the site*, that works.
    - *You want to read questions in the following languages*, works but
      is buggy: the default language for the group (English) doesn't
      show up in the list of languages when asking a question, nor in
      the filter when listing questions.
  - Weird limitation on password size: `Password is too long (maximum is
    20 characters)`.
  - Browser compatibility: I faced some issues while signing up, login
    in, or joining a group. But all that seems to work fine from Tails.

Q2A
---

  - <http://www.question2answer.org/>
  - Written in PHP
  - <https://github.com/q2a/question2answer> but only one commit per
    release!
  - No dependencies outside of PHP and MySQL
  - No public developers tools?
    <http://www.question2answer.org/qa/3665/can-find-q2a-project-repository-anywhere-like-sourceforge>
  - Many plugins by the community:
    <http://www.question2answer.org/addons.php>
  - Four releases in 2012

### Features

    check on the email address.
  - Categories, see <http://frageee.de/>
  - Only translatable, no multilingual support
  - Markdown editor, as a plugin:
    <http://codelair.co.uk/11/markdown-editor-plugin-q2a>
  - Captcha, as a plugin
    <https://github.com/KrzysztofKielce/q2a-captcha-antibot>
  - Email notifications, as a plugin with minimal features (no
    subscription, not handling categories, etc.)
    <https://github.com/sawtoothsoftware/Q2A-Email-Notifications>
  - Question2Answer Network Sites, a plugin to link a network of Q2A
    site, including the possibility of migrating questions between sites
    of a same farm (experimental).

Others
------

  - [Reddit](https://github.com/reddit/reddit), not really Q&A.

Things left to be done
----------------------

  - Remove connections to Google API. Replace the usage of external
    jqueryui to one we host ourselves, see
    <http://jira.osqa.net/browse/OSQA-814>.
  - Document the search engine issue at installation.
    If the permission to create TRIGGER is not grant, run
    `forum_modules/mysqlfulltext/fts_install.sql` by hand as root.
  - Remove ‘Reliable OSQA Hosting’ from the sidebar.
  - Customize the CSS to fit in the website.
  - Discuss whether OSQA should be better linked from the homepage.
    [[!tag todo/discuss]]
  - Add a ‘hardware’ tag.
  - Encourage people to use the appropriate ways to report bugs, and
    get getter support this way, proposal:
    “You are much more likely to get help with hardware related issues,
    and bugs, if you report them using WhisperBack. See
    [[doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]]".
  - Make the submission of an email optional when registering.
  - Get the source code in a Git repository using `git-svn`.
