We need to start testing Tails built against Wheezy.

Work is done our the `feature/wheezy` Git branch.

**Current state**: does not build due to packages in our `devel` APT
suite.

[[!toc levels=2]]

Problems to fix
===============

[[!tag todo/code]]

* Prepare and upload Wheezy versions of those of our custom packages
  that currently break the build:
  - `iceweasel`
  - `liveusb-creator`
  - `python-dbus`
  - `yelp`
* `amnesia` users sudoers credentials to localize console at profile
  time don't work
* `tails-greeter` is not installed
* `/usr/local/sbin/udev-watchdog` not found
* I2P packages are not removed (uninstallable on Wheezy)
* `scim-pinyin`, `scim-uim` and `scim-hangul` must be replaced by the Wheezy equivalent
* Persistence for NM connections is broken. See [corresponding issue in
  Libert√©](https://github.com/mkdesu/liberte/issues/4)

Tests to do
===========

* is [[bugs/plymouth_stops_too_early]] fixed on Wheezy?
* is [[bugs/desktop_crashes_with_claws-mail_and_gpg-agent]]
  fixed on Wheezy?
