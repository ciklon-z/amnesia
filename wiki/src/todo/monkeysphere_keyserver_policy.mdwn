We currently ship Iceweasel with the `xul-ext-monkeysphere` addon,
which adds Monkeysphere into the mix for certificate validation when
using HTTPS. The Monkeysphere keyserver policy in Tails is set to
`unlessvalid` (the default), which means that the configured keyserver
will be queried only if Iceweasel's X.509 certificate validation
fails.

Is this a good idea?

* Imagine a MitM:ing attacker in control of some Tor exit. If a Tails
  user picks that exit for some HTTPS connection, and the attacker
  MitM:s it (resulting in a cert failure), the attacker has caused a
  *client-side* non-standard behavior, namely a key server query to a
  known hidden service. Could this be used in some way?

* What about the information this leaks to the keyserver?

Given that most (*understatement*) Tails users do not use
Monkeysphere, perhaps the safest thing to do is to change the
keyserver policy to `never`, at least until we known exactly what to
do with [[todo/monkeysphere]].
