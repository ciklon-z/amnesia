E.g. <https://twitter.com/codinghorror> does not render is any kind of
usable way on Tails 0.14. No useful information on iceweasel stdout/stderr.

Reproduced on:

* NV50 (nouveau driver), Tails 0.14, default settings
* libvirt (QXL), Tails 0.14, with and without iceweasel hardware
  acceleration enabled

Next thing to do is problably to [[!taglink todo/test]]:

* with Tails 0.13 and see if that's a regression
* with NoScript disabled
* with Tails >= 0.15~ to see if the updated NoScript fixes that
