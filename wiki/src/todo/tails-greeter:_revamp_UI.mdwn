Rationale
=========

 * tails-greeter exists and works (quite) fine
 * its code in not that bad anymore: now feasible to add features
 * its UI is difficult to use

We have to find a way to have an ergonomic UI.

Proposals
=========

Stop discouraging work on tails-greeter, bring positive input first
-------------------------------------------------------------------

People who have strong opinions on how t-g should work or should not,
please write this ASAP somewhere. We will start a thread on tails-dev about that.

Random ideas
------------

Some options should be probably setup differently. Typically like the language
one which already has a todo item.
[[todo/allow_choosing_language_at_installation_time]]

Clarify our specs and revisit past decisions
--------------------------------------------

e.g.

 * do we still want the first screen to look like a Windows (NT4) login screen?
 * do we still want a second screen for options? Or another way to show it?

Make an usability study?
------------------------

 * Draft several User eXperience (and layout) options
 * Make them testable
 * Make an usability study:
   - catch testers (Tails users and/or newbies)
   - make them test, see what they do and ask them what they think

We may want to ask input from UX experts, and/or pay one to run the usability
study.

Try something easier
--------------------

Drafting a new possible version first could be useful, and then we can decide
wether we want to ship it right away, or create other options and benchmark
them through a full-blown usability study

It's still possible to make a branch on the TailsGreeter repo and begin to
implement a proposal:

 * ask for ideas on tails-dev ML
 * propose 1 or 2 implementations
 * make "them" test and see what happens
   (other people may be able and willing to have such prototypes tested
   by first-time users, and might have himself interesting feedbacks).

The ones who draft new t-g UI may want to
have a look at gnome's studies on the subject (pages on <http://live.gnome.org>).

Pending questions
-----------------

* Do we want the look to depend on wether the Windows theme was opted-in?
* How much do we want to optimize for first-time users?

Next plans
==========

 * Do the "try something easier" way
   - ask for ideas
   - propose one or several prototypes
   - make some testing happen
   - extract something useful from the result
   - implements the choosen proposal
   Note: a developper commited to lots of thinks in that plan, but not to any dealine (not priority)!
 * If we get funding that for and it's still necessary, do the usability study

Prototypes
----------

Some proposals to test!

### Goal

My goals for the interface was:

    - read in "natural" order: top to bottom
    - no hidden windows/options
    - easy to adapt to right-to-left languages RTL
    - inspired/similar to GNOME3 "system perferences"

### Screenshots

Please test the script below, which lets you try the user experience!

The greeter started from DVD:

[[!img greeter.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

The greeter started from USB with persistence:

[[!img greeter+persistence.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

The greeter started from USB with persistence once language selected:

[[!img greeter+persistence+kbd.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

The greeter once the administration password option clicked:

[[!img greeter-opt-adm.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

The greeter once the keyboard option clicked:

[[!img greeter-opt-locale.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]

The greeter once the windows camouflage option clicked:

[[!img greeter-opt-persistence.png align="right" size="" alt=""]]



### How to test

Download everything in [[tails-greeter: revamp UI/mockups]], or better clone the git, go to the
directory and:

    $ ./mockup.py [-v <variant>] [-p]

Dependencies: gtk3, python gobject introspection (basically debian wheezy)

### Questions

I'd like to hear about:

    - your overall impression?
    - should keyboard selectable independently from locale in one click?
    - your navigation experience?
    - where should the locales box be?

### Remarks (add yours!)

    - add a symbol if option was visited/activated
    - activation of presets in persistence: when?

Reports
=======

Report #1
---------

User interface is confusing.

The combination of "green/red icons + the check mark + pushed button" is
really hard to grasp.

How about a big push button labeled "Persistence", maybe with an icon?

The current behaviour for "More options?" is also problematicâ€¦ How about
having a "More options" button at the bottom, near the "Login" button?
Ideally, this would require a "Back" button on the "Administration
password" scren, but even without it, I think the result will be easier
to understand/use.

>How about using checkmark boxes or Yes/No radial dials, or not use them at all? Entering a password into a box means it's enabled, and leaving it empty implies you don't wish to use the feature. The text in my example here is a bit big though:

Report #2
---------

A few impressions after the publication of the screenshots. Great job by the way!

The buttons ON/OFF are sometime confusing, as it's hard to know if it reflects the actual configuration, or the ability to modify this configuration, i.e. if the option is *actually* activated or if clicking on this button will toggle this option ON. I hope I'm clear enough :)

Please also keep in mind that some use small screens, and can get blocked if the cannot see the validation button.

Last point, as I will have to use Tails-greeter *at each boot*, I would like to be able to handle it easily with the keyboard, to save a lot of time.

That said, thanks a lot for the great job!
