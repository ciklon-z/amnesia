Since bridges are easily detected and blocked in some areas (in
particular China, but also places where wholesale SSL blocking is
used), we need to support
[obfsproxy](https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy-instructions.html.en).

Also, in situations where both reliability *and* obfuscation are required
despite an adversary having control of the user's local network
*traffic obfuscation* must also be employed. This traffic obfuscation
is **imperative** where the user's welfare or liberty my be
jeopardised by her use of Tor.
The [Obfsproxy](https://tails.boum.org/todo/obfsproxy/) project exists
to achieve the benefits of Tor's bridges together with traffic
obfuscation.

There was a Vidalia [plugin](http://gitorious.org/obfs_gui/) project
which could have made the configuration easier for the end user, and
more easily integrated into our current [[bridge
mode|todo/bridge_support]]; however, we're told it is stillborn.

A complete TBB+Obfsproxy bundle is available from the 
project's page. The default configuration file is set 
to connect via a selection of preconfigured obfs2 
bridges. It all just works<sup>tm</sup>

obfsproxy is now part of Debian.
