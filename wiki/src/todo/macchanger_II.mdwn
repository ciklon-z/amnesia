I would like to add the following changes to the macchanger todo. Unfortunately this is not possible due to [[https://tails.boum.org/support/known_issues/index.en.html?updated#index1h2]]:


Change:
-------

Integration -> Implementation


Add:
----

Fortunately the wheel doesn't need to be reinvented since an example implementation can be found at

[[https://we.riseup.net/riseuphelp+en/auto-random-macs]] .


Change:
-------

Rationale -> Caveats

and move from the beginning to the end.
