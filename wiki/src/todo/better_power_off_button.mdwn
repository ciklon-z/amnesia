We've been [[asked|todo/Reactivate_the_power_off_menu]] numerous times
to make the emergency shutdown button a bit less dangerous, especially
since it's close to the "Close this window" button.

Many solutions were proposed, here's the one we will implement:

Let's leave this button at the same top-right place; clicking it
should open a dropdown menu with three entries:

- Lock screen (requires the addition of the package *xscreensaver* )
- Shutdown *immediately*
- Reboot *immediately*

This way:

- it looks like the GNOME3 top-right menu
- it's still pretty fast to use in emergency situations
- reboot comes back
- much less dangerous

# Implementation

A simple GNOME applet for this has been developed in the branch
`feature/better_power_off_button`. There are some issues:

## Issues to be solved or discussed.

[[!tag todo/discuss]]

* For the "Lock screen" action we need to implement
  [[todo/screen_locker]]. This branch currently implements using the
  "Password-less amnesia account" approach, which turned out to be
  problematic (see ticket).

* To avoid the previous item, maybe we can ship the applet without the
  "Lock Screen" action until [[todo/screen_locker]] has been solved?

* Translations work for the applet (i.e. its action menu entries) but
  I don't know (I haven't even investigated) how to make its bonobo
  server file translatable. That would make the strings shown in the
  applet list (as seen via "Add to panel" for instance)
  translatable. IMHO this isn't important and I'd rather not waste my
  energy on it. What do you think?

* Since "Shutdown Immediately" is right below "Lock Screen" in the
  menu, I assume users could miss-click it pretty easily. Perhaps
  making the menu entries larger and/or putting separators between
  them could help prevent that.

* The icon it currently uses for "Reboot Immediately" is
  "gtk-refresh". It seems like the default GNOME theme doesn't have a
  dedicated icon for reboot. We could use the same icon as for
  "Shutdown Immediately" but I'd rather have something distinct.
