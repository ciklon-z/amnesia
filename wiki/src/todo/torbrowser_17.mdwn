Firefox 10.x ESR will be end-of-lifed mid-February. Tails 0.17 is
scheduled for late February, so it will have to ship the next ESR
series: Firefox 17.

Roadmap
=======

1. Upload alpha ISO.
1. Test, test, test (see **Test** section below).
1. Fix whatever needs fixing (see **Code** section below).
1. Have it merged in time for RC1.

Code
====

[[!tag todo/code]]

Being worked on in the `feature/torbrowser` branch of our main Git
repository, and in our iceweasel Git repository.

Fix bookmarks
-------------

Only the bookmarks at the root (*Tails* and *Tails documentation
(offline)*) are shown. The sub-folders (*Webmail*, *Tor*, *I2P*) are
not displayed.

We have to fix the default bookmarks file to fix that, and then test
lots of things (move to **Test** section when it's time to):

1. Backward compatibility:
   - Make sure persistent bookmarks saved in Tails 0.16 are displayed.
   - Make sure one can modify persistent bookmarks coming from an
     older version, and see them persist on next boot.
1. Make sure one can setup persistence for bookmarks from the new ISO,
   and make sure it works (setup persistence, reboot, enable
   persistence, add bookmarks, reboot, enable persistence, bookmarks
   should still be here).

Infrastructure
==============

1. [[!taglink todo/wait]] for immerda to create our `tails/torbutton.git` repository.

Test
====

[[!tag todo/qa]]

* Try it, use it! (**warning**: this is experimental stuff, don't rely
  too much on it...)
* Check that the `User-Agent` is set
  correctly to `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:17.0) Gecko/20100101
  Firefox/17.0` by `general.useragent.override`
* Check that add-ons work properly:
  - Adblock Plus
  - amnesia branding
  - Cookie Monster
  - FoxyProxy
  - HTTPS Everywhere
  - NoScript
  - Torbutton new identity
* Check <https://panopticlick.eff.org/> for regressions.
* Check <http://ip-check.info/> for regressions.
* [[fingerprint section|support/known_issues#fingerprint]]

1. Upload iceweasel package.

After Tails 0.17, we'll want to...

* Apply `0024-Isolate-the-Image-Cache-per-url-bar-domain.patch`.
* Apply `0026-Isolate-DOM-storage-to-first-party-URI.patch`, set
  `dom.storage.enabled` to true, and set
  `extensions.torbutton.disable_domstorage` to false.
