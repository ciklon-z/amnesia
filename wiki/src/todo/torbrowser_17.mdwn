Firefox 10.x ESR will be end-of-lifed mid-February. Tails 0.17 is
scheduled for late February, so it will have to ship the next ESR
series: Firefox 17.

Roadmap
=======

1. Test, test, test (see **Test** section below).
1. Fix whatever needs fixing (see **Code** section below).
1. Have it merged in time for RC1.

Code
====

[[!tag todo/code]]

Being worked on in the `feature/torbrowser` branch of our main Git
repository, and in our iceweasel Git repository.

Test
====

[[!tag todo/qa]]

* Try it, use it! (**warning**: this is experimental stuff, don't rely
  too much on it...)
* WebGL (click-to-play), e.g. Google Maps' *MapsGL* optional feature
  (works in TBB alpha)

Done
====

1. Build iceweasel package.
1. Upload iceweasel package.
1. Build Torbutton [1.5.0pre-alpha](https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/) package.
1. Upload Torbutton package.
1. Build alpha ISO.
1. Upload alpha ISO.

Tests
-----

* Check that add-ons work properly:
  - Adblock Plus
  - amnesia branding
  - Cookie Monster
  - FoxyProxy
    * I2P
    * I2P console
    * LAN
  - HTTPS Everywhere
  - Torbutton new identity
* bookmarks
   - Make sure persistent bookmarks saved in Tails 0.16 are displayed
     after upgrading.
   - Make sure one can setup persistence for bookmarks from the new
     ISO, and make sure it works (setup persistence, reboot, enable
     persistence, add bookmarks, reboot, enable persistence, bookmarks
     should still be here).
   - Make sure one can modify persistent bookmarks coming from an
     older version, and see them persist on next boot.
* Check <http://ip-check.info/> for regressions: same results as Tails
  0.16, but "You are using Tor, but your browser profile differs from
  the recommended `Tor Browser Bundle` default profile", that is
  displayed with the alpha TBB too (probably resulting from the
  different `User Agent` header).
* Check <https://panopticlick.eff.org/> for regressions: same results
  as Tails 0.16, modulo more identifying bits in the `User Agent`,
  obviously:  this will fix itself once TBB ships with Torbrowser 17.
* YouTube

Later
=====

After Tails 0.17, we'll want to...

* Apply `0024-Isolate-the-Image-Cache-per-url-bar-domain.patch`.
* Apply `0026-Isolate-DOM-storage-to-first-party-URI.patch`, set
  `dom.storage.enabled` to true, and set
  `extensions.torbutton.disable_domstorage` to false.
