We've been asked to include Bitcoin.

Quoting the Debian package description: "Full transaction history is
stored locally at each client. This requires 150+ MB of space, slowly
growing", so persistence is needed.

The only missing bit, then, is remembering to install a Bitcoin client
that was cached in the persistence storage. The correct way to deal
with such feature requests probably is to implement
[[todo/remember_installed_packages]].

So, we will *not* include Bitcoin software in Tails.

> Only missing bit? The conclusion misses reasoning.

There are alternative thin btc clients only 1 or 5 MB in size. They do not require downloading the blockchain.

Electrum looks good.

Please reconsider. REmoved the done tag and added research tag.
