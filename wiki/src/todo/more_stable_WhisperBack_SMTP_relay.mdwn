WhisperBack SMTP relay is too often down, while we have two instances,
including one on a stable server.

A second one is now up, and actively serving.

We should now:

1. Test load-balancing / failover to see what Tor hidden services
   provide for free.
1. Make sure we at least get failover. If that does not come for free,
   a stupid cronjob to restart Tor when needed should do the job.
