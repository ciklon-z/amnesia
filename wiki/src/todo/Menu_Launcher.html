<p>We need to make the launcher in Tails look like the "start menu" in Windows( eg: bit.ly/OrSHi5 ). We should do this for Windows XP camouflage, Windows Vista camouflage, and Windows 7 camouflage. We can use bit.ly/QGTNw for Windows 7 camouflage, and we can use bit.ly/QfmNRj for Windows Vista camouflage (Both of these themes already include the Windows like "start menu", so the only thing we would need to do is create a "start menu" for the Windows XP camouflage).</p>
