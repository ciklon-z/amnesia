iceweasel add-ons update is set to automatic.

This probably should not be the case.

Implemented in `feature/disable-iceweasel-extensions-auto-update`,

Once this is implemented, one would want to check if the "iceweasel
connects to tails.b.o" problem reported on
[[todo/improve_fingerprint_of_the_Unsafe_Browser]] is fixed by
this change.
