Visited an English speaking open-publishing website
(http://atlanta.indymedia.org/), started to publish
=> dictionary is automatically set to French (Luxembourg) in the main textarea.

Looking around on the web, it looks like it's expected that iceweasel
picks any seemingly random dictionary as the default one.

We should improve the amnesia branding extension so that it sets the
preferred dictionary according to the current locale.

Implemented in `bugfix/fix_default_iceweasel_spelling_language`,
candidate for Tails 0.17.
