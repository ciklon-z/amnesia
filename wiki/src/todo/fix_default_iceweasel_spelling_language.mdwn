Logged in with the default (English) settings.

Visited an English speaking open-publishing website
(http://atlanta.indymedia.org/), started to publish
=> dictionary is automatically set to French in the main textarea.

It looks like the default iceweasel dictionary is set to French no
matter what locales settings are chosen in Tails Greeter. I suspect
this is due to the locales used at build time, that have apparently
leaked into the profile generated at build time.

So either ensure the profile is generated in the C locale (possibly
with [localehelper](http://jwilk.net/software/localehelper)), or remove
the preferred dictionary setting from the generated profile, or
improve the amnesia branding extension so that it sets the preferred
dictionary according to the current locale.
