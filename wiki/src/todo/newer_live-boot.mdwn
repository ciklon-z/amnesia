Tails ships a relatively old live-boot. We need to resync' with upstream.

Pros (aside from the obvious):

* some persistence bugfixes that may improve data resilience
* once done, we might benefit from the new "Reading configuration file
  from filesystem and live-media at runtime too" feature to make our
  kernel command-line shorter

This is being worked on in the `feature/live-boot-3.x` branch.

Next things to do
=================
  
* live-boot 3.0~b4-1 to 3.0~b6-1 only support `persistence.conf`,
  while deployed Tails systems have `live-persistence.conf`. We have
  added compatibility code, so live-boot 3.0~b7 should support both.
  [[!taglink todo/wait]] for live-boot 3.0~b7 to be out.

* Once we have live-boot 3.0~b7, our `live-persist` script should be
  updated to export `old_persistence_list=live-persistence.conf` and
  `persistence_list=persistence.conf`, so that Tails does too.
  [[!tag todo/code]]

Done
====

* everything moved from `/live` to `/lib/live`, and might move again
  to `/lib/live/mount` (e.g. we rely on `/live/image`): so we ship
  a compatibility symlink first, be done with it on the
  short term, and we will then adapt our scripts and programs one
  after the other.
