Tails ships a relatively old live-boot. We need to resync' with upstream.

Pros (aside from the obvious):

* some persistence bugfixes that may improve data resilience
* once done, we might benefit from the new "Reading configuration file
  from filesystem and live-media at runtime too" feature to make our
  kernel command-line shorter

This is being worked on in the `feature/live-boot-3.x` branch.

Next things to do
=================
  
* live-boot 3.0~b4-1 to 3.0~b6-1 only support `persistence.conf`,
  while deployed Tails systems have `live-persistence.conf`. We have
  added compatibility code and live-boot 3.0~b7 now supports both
  => install live-boot 3.0~b7 and live-config >=3.0.9-1 [[!tag todo/code]]

* Once we have live-boot 3.0~b7, our `live-persist` script should be
  updated to export `old_persistence_list=live-persistence.conf` and
  `persistence_list=persistence.conf`, so that Tails does too.
  [[!tag todo/code]]

* live-boot mounts now live in `/lib/live/mount`, and `/live/image`
  now lives in `/lib/live/mount/medium`; should be updated
  accordingly: [[!tag todo/code]]
  - liveusb-creator: `liveusb/config.py`
  - tails-iuk: `lib/Tails/IUK/Install.pm`
  - tails-persistence-setup: `lib/Tails/Persistence/Setup.pm`
  - `config/chroot_local-includes/lib/live/config/9980-permissions`
  - `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/bin/tails-get-bootinfo`
  - `config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/sbin/udev-watchdog-wrapper`
  - `git grep -w live/image -- config` to make sure there are no others

Done
====

* everything moved from `/live` to `/lib/live`, and might move again
  to `/lib/live/mount` (e.g. we rely on `/live/image`): so we ship
  a compatibility symlink first, be done with it on the
  short term, and we will then adapt our scripts and programs one
  after the other.
