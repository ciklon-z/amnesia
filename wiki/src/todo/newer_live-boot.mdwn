Tails ships a relatively old live-boot. We need to resync' with upstream.

Pros (aside from the obvious):

* some persistence bugfixes that may improve data resilience
* once done, we might benefit from the new "Reading configuration file
  from filesystem and live-media at runtime too" feature to make our
  kernel command-line shorter

Beware:

* everything moved from `/live` to `/lib/live`, and might move again
  to `/lib/live/mount` (e.g. we rely on `/live/image`):
  ship a compatibility symlink, be done with it on the short term,
  and then adapt our scripts and programs one after the other?
  
* since 3.0~b4-1, `live-persistence.conf` was renamed to
  `persistence.conf`, and upstream did not reply to
  [our request for clarification and backward compat'](https://lists.debian.org/debian-live/2012/09/msg00163.html),
  so we have to handle the transition ourselves, somehow:
  1. Have tails-persistence-setup use the new filename.
  1. Handle the migration (file move) at persistence activation time.
