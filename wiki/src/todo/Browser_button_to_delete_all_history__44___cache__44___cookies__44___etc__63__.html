perhaps i'm unclear on this, but if you grab a "New Identity" thru one of the Tor onion icons in the browser, shouldn't we also at that point want to dump/clear all cache, history, cookies, any temp files, etc etc? And rather than going into Edit > Preferences to delete some of this stuff it seems we would be better off with some type of button that does this with one click. There are several available for firefox iirc or maybe a custom button?


Also, shouldn't Edit > Preferences > Privacy > Location Bar be set to "When using the location bar suggest > Nothing"?
