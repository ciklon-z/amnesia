We now have a [[todo/boot_menu]], support many languages and go beyond
the 700MB limit, so we can install the software and dictionaries
needed to get the spell-checker feature working at least in iceweasel,
Gedit, and OpenOffice.

Data points:

 - openoffice and libreoffice use hunspell
 - gedit uses the Enchant library, that itself supports hunspell and
   aspell
 - iceweasel uses myspell

**Next thing to do:** Given hunspell is based on myspell, [[!taglink
todo/research]] if iceweasel can use the former instead of the latter.
