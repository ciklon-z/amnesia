In a distribution that has non-free software, privacy and anonymity
are at risk. As TAILS is a distribution that protects the privacy and
anonymity of its users, it is implied that it will include and
recommend only free software.

distributions that do not use or recommend non-free software.
TAILS could be listed there and promote its use by activists and other
users that value privacy and anonymity.
