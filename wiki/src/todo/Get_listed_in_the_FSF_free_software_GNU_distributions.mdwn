In a distribution that has non-free software, privacy and anonymity
are at risk. As TAILS is a distribution that protects the privacy and
anonymity of its users, it is implied that it will include and
recommend only free software.

The Free Software Foundation currently holds a list of GNU
distributions that do not use or recommend non-free software.
TAILS could be listed there and promote its use by activists and other
users that value privacy and anonymity.

There are working free distros such as gnewsense and trisquel, if a tails user failed his/her hardware with this core tails, the firmware blobs (and/or themes and other packages) could be downloaded possibly through the incremental (or should I say optional in this case?) upgrades package.
> In the end every user would win, but although OP point is somewhat valid and tails could benefit from including only free software, usability being badly sacrificed in order to be included in a list..well probably not a good idea ;)
> As a bonus perhaps the proposed solution could allow "core tails" to fit in a cd again. Just an idea ~ Hypothesys
