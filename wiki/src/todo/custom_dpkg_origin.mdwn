We should add vendor-specific dpkg origin information.

This would make dpkg-vendor return correct information. See deb-origin(5) and dpkg-vendor(1) for details.

This was suggested by Paul Wise <pabs@debian.org> on the
debian-derivatives mailing-list.

Implemented in `feature/dpkg-origin`, merged into devel.
[[!taglink todo/pending]] for Tails 0.15.
