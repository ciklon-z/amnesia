The software developed by JonDonym should be added to tails. It can be found at

[[http://anonymous-proxy-servers.net/en/software.html]]

and includes

+ JonDo â€“ the IP changer client

+ JonDoFox - a Firefox profile for anonymous web surfing

+ other data protection tools

+ etc.

Moreover their Live-CD could offer some useful solutions for Tails, too.

The Tails browser should also be tested against their anonymity test:
