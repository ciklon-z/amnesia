Wheezy's GDM removes features such as setting the keyboard layout.

It's not clear if the rest of the `GdmGreeterService` interface
changes, and I was not able to find any developer documentation
on this.

The way the greeter component is started seems to have changed (e.g.
I had to rename `tails-greeter.desktop` to
`gdm-simple-greeter.desktop` to have it started at all, and the result
displays no window at all). I was not able to find any documentation
on this. Nor did I find any existing custom greeter for GDM 3.x.

So basically, GDM nowadays looks not very inviting not to say
hostile...) to us custom greeter developers.

So we may want to [[!taglink todo/research]] how to use GDM anyway, or
find a better alternative.

On the other hand, [lightdm](https://launchpad.net/lightdm) has made
huge progress since the time we considered it in the early
pre-tails-greeter days:

* it's now used by default in Ubuntu with their
  [unity-greeter](https://launchpad.net/unity-greeter)
* there are at least [4
  greeters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightDM) in active
  development, and a few more example ones, so one may think upstream
  won't silently break the [well-documented
  interface](http://people.ubuntu.com/~robert-ancell/lightdm/reference/)
  without caring about downstreams
* upstream find it important enough to have various greeters to [blog
  about it](http://www.mattfischer.com/blog/?p=5) to give an overview
  of how to do it
* it knows how to set the language and keyboard layout
* one my write a greeter in any language that supports gobject
  introspection (examples exist at least in C, Vala and Python)

One should have a look at possible drawbacks, though:

* accessibility features, or lack thereof?
* security
