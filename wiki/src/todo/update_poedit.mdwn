Tails ships poedit 1.4.2

Poedit 1.5 is [now available](https://github.com/vslavik/poedit/blob/master/NEWS), and claims to [fix the annoying wordwraping problem](http://www.poedit.net/trac/ticket/25), among other imrovements.

We should:

1. [[!taglink todo/test]] it
1. [[!taglink todo/wait]] for it to reach Debian sid or experimental,
   which might include a bit more work than just waiting:
   [[!debbug 684924]]
1. backport it
1. update Poedit in Tails
