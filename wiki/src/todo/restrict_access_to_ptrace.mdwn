The Yama LSM "collects a number of system-wide DAC security
protections that are not handled by the core kernel itself", including
ptrace scope restrictions on which user/process can examine the memory
and running state of other processes.

Yama is part of the mainline Linux kernel since 3.4 (and its link
restrictions features merged into the core kernel, outside of the LSM,
in 3.6).

Since Linux 3.7, the Yama LSM can be automatically stacked regardless
of which security module is the "primary" module, so it's compatible
with [[using AppArmor some day|todo/Mandatory_Access_Control]].

1. Decide if we want "1 - restricted ptrace" or "2 - admin-only
   attach" mode: [[!taglink todo/test]] the most restrictive one (mode
   2), and see if it breaks something we care about.
1. [[!taglink todo/test]] compatibility with AppArmor
1. [[!taglink todo/wait]] for Tails to ship Linux 3.4 or later (once
   the Debian kernel team starts maintaining a recent kernel in sid,
   that is probably after Wheezy is out)
