I am concerned about lack of entropy in the system when Tails starts, which, unless I misunderstand something, could potentially cause the system to create weak SSL keys for initial connections.  

Would it be feasible/worthwhile to for the Tails system to ask the user to move the mouse and type in a window while the Tails browser is trying to make its first connection?

I also have some concerns about default settings.  Would it be possible to add an option alongside the option to choose a root password, when Tails is first booting, which says "configure before connect"?  If the user chooses that, once Tails has booted:

* the default is no internet connection and no WiFi enabled, so the user can change a few things before using the Gnome Network manager to turn either or both on
* the user has the opportunity to start the Tor browser and make a few changes in the configuration, also in the NoScript configuration, for better security at the cost of possibly worse anonymity.

This would be enormously helpful to some of us who cannot use a bootable USB drive but must boot from the DVD (which might offer better security in any case).
