[[!meta title="Adding a VNC server app to Tails"]]

It would be nice to have a VNC server app on Tails.

There would be various uses of such an app, I thought about it since I'm using
'Vine' on my Mac for rigging my Kindle screen to the one of my laptop (lots of
reasons why do I do that) . As those apps are generally around 2 mb, I guess it
won't be an enormous burden to implement in tails, unless it compromises its
security somehow.

I'm curious to know what do you think about that idea.

Greets!
