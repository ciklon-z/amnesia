It would be nice to have a VNC server app on Tails.<br /> <br /> 


There would be various uses of such an app, I thought about it since I'm using 'Vine' on my Mac for rigging my Kindle screen to the one of my laptop (lots of reasons why do I do that) . As those apps are generally around 2 mb, I guess it won't be an enormous burden to implement in tails, unless it compromises its security somehow. <br /><br /> 


I'm curious to know what do you think about that idea. <br /> <br /> 


Greets!
