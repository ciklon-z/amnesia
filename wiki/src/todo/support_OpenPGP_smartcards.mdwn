Plans
=====

1. Get recent ccid / pcscd into Tails (it helps supporting some
   devices, see bellow) -- this is feature/OpenPGP-SmartCard:
   **done** (merged into devel, pending for Tails 0.15)
1. Publish a test ISO -- this should be 0.15~rc1
1. Ask for feedback from owners of supposedly-fixed hardware
   [[!tag todo/test]]
1. [[!taglink todo/research]] how to support hardware despite the
   Seahorse bug

Tests
=====

## Test 0

I tested an OpenPGP smart card reader and card (which I will add the
brandt/model soon). It turned out that it worked for me on Tails 0.13~rc1
without any additional package installed *but* only when executing gnupg as
root. It seems there is a permission issue, as discussed on tails-dev (see
below).

This is despite the fact that the `amnesia` user actually has proper access
(through an ACL) to the USB device:

    $ lsusb | grep SCM
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 04e6:5115 SCM Microsystems, Inc. SCR335 SmartCard Reader
    $ getfacl -a /dev/bus/usb/002/004
    # file: dev/bus/usb/002/004
    # owner: root
    # group: root
    user::rw-
    user:amnesia:rw-

It looks like the problem is related to Seahorse: commenting `use-agent` in
`~/gnupg/gpg.conf` will enable GnuPG to use the card without extra permissions.
One can also call the following:

    GPG_AGENT_INFO= gpg --card-status

This is tracked as <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=530439>, no
progress since 2008.

## Test 1

[gemalto USB shell token v2](http://shop.kernelconcepts.de/product_info.php?products_id=119)

	lsusb:
	  Bus 001 Device 005: ID 08e6:3438 Gemplus GemPC Key SmartCard Reader

	gpg --card-status:
	  gpg: detected reader `Gemalto GemPC Key 00 00'
	  Application ID ...: D2760001240102000005000014DA0000
	  Version ..........: 2.0
	  Manufacturer .....: ZeitControl

What kind of additional software is needed?

Testing with Tails 0.12.1 I've found it was necessary to install the following set of packages from Debian Wheezy.

* libc-bin (2.13-35)
* libc6 (2.13-35)
* multiarch-support
* libpcsclite1 (1.8.4-1)
* libccid (1.4.7-1)
* pcscd (1.8.4-1)

If Tails begins building on Wheezy, including the libccid and pcscd
package should be enough for Gemalto USB shell Token (A USB smart card
reader) that is popularly used with OpenPGP cards.

> It looks like all the additional packages were pulled as
> dependencies of pcscd and libccid.

>> Backports were built, tested and uploaded.

>> The user credentials issues are discussed on tails-dev:

## Test 2

gemalto USB shell token v2 (see details in test #1)

### with pcscd installed

* can't use the card as a non-root user
* can use the card as a non-root user who is a member of the `pcscd` group
* can use the card as root

### without pcscd, without gnupg-pkcs11-scd

* can't use the card as a non-root user
* can't use the card as a non-root user who is a member of the
  `pcscd` group
* can't use the card as root

### without pcscd, with gnupg-pkcs11-scd

adding a line containing:

`scdaemon-program /usr/bin/gnupg-pkcs11-scd`  to `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`

=> does not help, but perhaps it was not setup correctly.

## Test 3

[[!taglink todo/wait]] for results from Patrick Bx:

  * with gnupg2, pcscd and scdaemon (as per Corsac's howto)
  * his `GPG_AGENT_INFO`
  * the `getfacl` output on the USB device

* Libert√© Linux' implementation: ccid, pcsc-lite, GnuPG built without
  libusb support, and `gnupg-pkcs11-scd` used as a `scdaemon-program`
  (available, commented-out in the default `gpg-agent.conf`); see
  commit f29ce64272 in their Git. Their reason for disabling CCID over
  libusb ("supporting direct CCID interface via libusb makes no sense,
  since the devices are accessible only to "pcscd" daemon") may not
  apply in the Debian and Tails case, since the packages take care to
  give access to devices to the `amnesia` user, using an ACL.
