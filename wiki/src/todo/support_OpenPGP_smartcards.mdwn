## Test 0

I tested an OpenPGP smart card reader and card (which I will add the
brandt/model soon). It turned out that it worked for me on Tails 0.13~rc1
without any additional package installed *but* only when executing gnupg as
root. It seems there is a permission issue, as discussed on tails-dev (see
below).

## Test 1

gemalto USB shell token v2:
<http://shop.kernelconcepts.de/product_info.php?products_id=119>

	lsusb:
	  Bus 001 Device 005: ID 08e6:3438 Gemplus GemPC Key SmartCard Reader

	gpg --card-status:
	  gpg: detected reader `Gemalto GemPC Key 00 00'
	  Application ID ...: D2760001240102000005000014DA0000
	  Version ..........: 2.0
	  Manufacturer .....: ZeitControl

What kind of additional software is needed?

Testing with Tails 0.12.1 I've found it was necessary to install the following set of packages from Debian Wheezy.

* libc-bin (2.13-35)
* libc6 (2.13-35)
* multiarch-support
* libpcsclite1 (1.8.4-1)
* libccid (1.4.7-1)
* pcscd (1.8.4-1)

If Tails begins building on Wheezy, including the libccid and pcscd
package should be enough for Gemalto USB shell Token (A USB smart card
reader) that is popularly used with OpenPGP cards.

> It looks like all the additional packages were pulled as
> dependencies of pcscd and libccid.

## Test 2

gemalto USB shell token v2 (see details in test #1)

### with pcscd installed

* can't use the card as a non-root user
* can use the card as a non-root user who is a member of the `pcscd` group
* can use the card as root

### without pcscd, without gnupg-pkcs11-scd

* can't use the card as a non-root user
* can't use the card as a non-root user who is a member of the
  `pcscd` group
* can't use the card as root

### without pcscd, with gnupg-pkcs11-scd

adding a line containing:

`scdaemon-program /usr/bin/gnupg-pkcs11-scd`  to `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`

=> does not help, but perhaps it was not setup correctly.
