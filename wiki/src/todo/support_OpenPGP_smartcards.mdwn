## Test 0

I tested an OpenPGP smart card reader and card (which I will add the
brandt/model soon). It turned out that it worked for me on Tails 0.13~rc1
without any additional package installed *but* only when executing gnupg as
root. It seems there is a permission issue, as discussed on tails-dev (see
below).

## Test 1

What kind of additional software is needed?

Testing with Tails 0.12.1 I've found it was necessary to install the following set of packages from Debian Wheezy.

* libc-bin (2.13-35)
* libc6 (2.13-35)
* multiarch-support
* libpcsclite1 (1.8.4-1)
* libccid (1.4.7-1)
* pcscd (1.8.4-1)

If Tails begins building on Wheezy, including the libccid and pcscd
package should be enough for Gemalto USB shell Token (A USB smart card
reader) that is popularly used with OpenPGP cards.

> It looks like all the additional packages were pulled as
> dependencies of pcscd and libccid.
