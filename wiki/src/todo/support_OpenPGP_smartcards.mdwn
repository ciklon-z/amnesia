## Test 0

I tested an OpenPGP smart card reader and card (which I will add the
brandt/model soon). It turned out that it worked for me on Tails 0.13~rc1
without any additional package installed *but* only when executing gnupg as
root. It seems there is a permission issue, as discussed on tails-dev (see
below).

This is despite the fact that the `amnesia` user actually has proper access
(through an ACL) to the USB device:

    $ lsusb | grep SCM
    Bus 002 Device 004: ID 04e6:5115 SCM Microsystems, Inc. SCR335 SmartCard Reader
    $ getfacl -a /dev/bus/usb/002/004
    # file: dev/bus/usb/002/004
    # owner: root
    # group: root
    user::rw-
    user:amnesia:rw-

It looks like the problem is related to Seahorse: commenting `use-agent` in
`~/gnupg/gpg.conf` will enable GnuPG to use the card without extra permissions.
One can also call the following:

    GPG_AGENT_INFO= gpg --card-status

This is tracked as <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=530439>, no
progress since 2008.

## Test 1

What kind of additional software is needed?

Testing with Tails 0.12.1 I've found it was necessary to install the following set of packages from Debian Wheezy.

* libc-bin (2.13-35)
* libc6 (2.13-35)
* multiarch-support
* libpcsclite1 (1.8.4-1)
* libccid (1.4.7-1)
* pcscd (1.8.4-1)

If Tails begins building on Wheezy, including the libccid and pcscd
package should be enough for Gemalto USB shell Token (A USB smart card
reader) that is popularly used with OpenPGP cards.

> It looks like all the additional packages were pulled as
> dependencies of pcscd and libccid.

>> Backports were built and tested, and should now be uploaded.
