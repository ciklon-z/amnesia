For whatever reason our firewall seems to not block all IPv6 packets,
like it should. For instance, Tails leaks link-local multicast
(ff02::1/64).

For now a simple solution to block this leak would be to disable
IPv6 altoghether, i.e. by putting: [[!tag todo/code]]

    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1

in `/etc/sysctl.conf`.

But on the long run, we want IPv6 to work to some extent (e.g.
for [[OnionCat|todo/install_OnionCat]]), so the root cause should be
found. To start with, we should [[!taglink todo/test]] with IPv6
enabled to see if there are other culprits,
and [[!taglink todo/research]] the root cause of the issue.
