Sub-tickets
===========

* [[todo/disable expresscard?]]
* [[todo/disable pcmcia?]]
* [[todo/disable_firewire?]]
* disable Thunderbolt?

Implementation ideas
====================

* If a firewire card was inserted into the slot and the bus is active,
  pop up a dialog and ask "hey, you want to use firewire/etc.?"
* disable these buses by default, allow opt-in through tails-greeter
  to enable
* ask that users assert they want to use this or that bus, and make
  the assertion bind to a single device, rather than all devices
  blindly
* de-activate PCMCIA and ExpressCard on systems that don't have any
  PCMCIA or ExpressCard devices after running for 5 minutes. This is
  going to byte some users, but probably only the first time.

Test for vulnerability
======================

* [inception](http://www.breaknenter.org/projects/inception/), "a
  FireWire physical memory manipulation and hacking tool". It
  supposedly supports "FireWire/Thunderbolt/ExpressCard/PCMCIA".


Discussion
======================

* If/when Tails [[Server_Edition]] is implemented this would be a useful part of the package. A Tails server left running would benefit highly from being protected against external bus memory attacks. A [[screen_locker]] plus the external bus protection would be important features for Tails server.
