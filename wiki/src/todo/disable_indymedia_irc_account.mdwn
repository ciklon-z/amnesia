At the beginning of 2013, irc.indymedia.org banned access to their
server from Tor, if not using SASL.

Pigdin 2.7.3 does not support SASL.

Probably Pidgin 2.10.7 will support SASL but it's not out yet.

See <https://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/13270>

We propose to remove the preconfigured IRC account until we can ship a
version of pidgin that supports SASL.
